## Tech Stack

- [Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/node): a JavaScript runtime.
- [Knex](https://github.com/knex/knex): a query builder for PostgreSQL, MySQL and SQLite3, designed to be flexible, portable, and fun to use.
- [Express](https://github.com/expressjs/express): a fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.
- [bcrypt](https://github.com/pyca/bcrypt/): modern(-ish) password hashing for your software and your servers.
- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/): Postman helps you be more efficient while working with APIs. Using Postman, you can construct complex HTTP requests quickly, organize them in collections and share them with your co-workers.
