# Homebrew

Homebrew is a piece of software for macOS that lets you install extra unix
software on your Mac.

We will need it from time to time so it's a good thing to install.

Head to the [homebrew](http://brew.sh) website at http://brew.sh and on the main
page are instructions.

They say to run a command like this, so open a Terminal and run this:

```shell
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

After some output it should print out that homebrew is installed successfully.

You can always check homebrew for possible problems by typing this:

```shell
brew doctor
```

That's it for brew for now, move on to your other installations!
