 * Many features of exerslide are actually made available via runtime plugins.

 * The following plugin enables keyboard navigation. This sets up the default

 * (key combinations) and call the corresponding function providing an API to
 * control the presentation. Currently provided is
 *
 * - nextSlide(): Advance to the next slide
 * - previousSlide(): Go back to the previous slide
 *
 * We use https://craig.is/killing/mice to bind the event handlers. Have
 * a look at the documentation to find out how to specify key combinations.
