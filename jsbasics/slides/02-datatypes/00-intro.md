JavaScript has *6* data types. Five of those are so called *primitive* data
types:

- Boolean
- Number
- String
- Null
- Undefined

Everything else that is not a value of one of the above types is an

- Object

As we will see in the following slides, objects belong to different kinds of
"classes" of objects.

<div class="callout secondary">

<i class="fa fa-info-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i> **ES2015**

ES2015 introduces a 6th primitive data type: *[Symbol][]*. Symbols are *unique* 
and *immutable* values.
