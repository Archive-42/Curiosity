# Learning Objectives - Element Selection
[JS](index.js)
[HTML](index.html)
1. ## Given HTML that includes `<div id=”catch-me-if-you-can”>HI!</div>`, write a JavaScript statement that stores a reference to the HTMLDivElement with the id “catch-me-if-you-can” in a variable named “divOfInterest”
<br>
<br>
<br>

2. ## Given HTML that includes seven SPAN elements each with the class “cloudy”, write a JavaScript statement that stores a reference to a NodeList filled with references to the seven HTMLSpanElements in a variable named “cloudySpans”
<br>
<br>
<br>

3. ## Given an HTML file with HTML, HEAD, TITLE, and BODY elements, create and reference a JS file that in which the JavaScript will create and attach to the BODY element an H1 element with the id "sleeping-giant" with the content "Jell-O, Burled!".
<br>
<br>
<br>

4. ## Given an HTML file with HTML, HEAD, TITLE, SCRIPT, and BODY elements with the SCRIPT's SRC attribute referencing an empty JS file, write a script in the JS file to create a DIV element with the id "lickable-frog" and add it as the last child to the BODY element.
<br>
<br>
<br>

5. ## Given an HTML file with HTML, HEAD, TITLE, SCRIPT, and BODY elements with no SRC attribute on the SCRIPT element, write a script in the SCRIPT block to create a UL element with no id, create an LI element with the id "dreamy-eyes", add the LI as a child to the UL element, and add the UL element as the first child of the BODY element.
<br>
<br>
<br>

6. ## Write JavaScript to add the CSS class "i-got-loaded" to the BODY element when the window fires the DOMContentLoaded event.
<br>
<br>
<br>

7. ## Given an HTML file with a UL element with the id "your-best-friend" that has six non-empty LIs as its children, write JavaScript to write the content of each LI to the console.
<br>
<br>
<br>

8.  ## Given an HTML file with a UL element with the id "your-worst-enemy" that has no children, write JavaScript to construct a string that contains six LI tags each containing a random number and set the inner HTML property of ul#your-worst-enemy to that string.
<br>
<br>
<br>

9.  ## Write JavaScript to update the title of the document to the current time at a reasonable interval such that it looks like a real clock.
