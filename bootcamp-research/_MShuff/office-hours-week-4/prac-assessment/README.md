# Selection, Event Handling, and Storage Practice Assessment Project

## Clone the GitHub Repository

Clone the GitHub repository located at
`https://github.com/appacademy-starters/practice-assessment-dom`.

If you get a `404` error when accessing that link, then you must contact your
PTM as soon as possible with the following message:

```plaintext
Hello, I cannot access the assessment project link.
My github username is <insert your username here>.
```

## Instructions

Open the "index.html" file in your browser. The HTML page contains a list of
tests that you must make pass to complete this portion of the practice
assessment.

For example, the first test reads:

**PROBLEM 1: Make the circle blue**

> - Button `id`: `make-circle-blue`
> - Div `id`: `blue-border-circle`
>
> When you click the button below, you should add the `"blue-fill"` CSS class to
> the blue circle. Adding the `"blue-fill"` CSS class will turn the inside of
> the circle blue.

Open "your-code.js" and write the code to make that happen. If you have written
the correct code, then you can click the button and see the circle turn blue.

**Don't forget to refresh your page when you make changes in the JavaScript
code!**

**You might want to use a VS code extension like Live Server, Problem #4 will
not work unless you have a server running, and it will refresh you page for you
as you save your JavaScript file**

Make all of the tests pass by writing code in "your-code.js" and interacting
with the test in the way specified.
