# Code Editors

- There are two types of code editors:
  - ## **Integrated Development Environment (IDE)**
    - An _IDE_ is a powerful editor with many features that operates on a "whole project"
    - Loads the projects, allows navigation between files, provides autocompletion, integrates a version management system (<a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a>), has a testing environment, and other project-level stuff
    - Many IDEs are paid, but have a trial period, and their price is negligible compared to a developer's salary
    - ## _Options_:
      - <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">**Visual Studio Code**</a> - Cross-Platform, Free
      - <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/community/">**Visual Studio Community(Windows)**</a> - A mighty editor that is well suited for the **.NET** platform, JavaScript, and many other languages. Comes in both paid and a free, community version
      - <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/">**WebStorm**</a> - Cross-Platform, Paid
  - ## **Lightweight Editors**
    - Not as powerful as IDEs, but are fast, elegant, and simple
    - Mainly used to edit a file instantly
    - The main difference between a lightweight editor and an IDE is that an IDE works on the project-level, meaning it loads more data on the start, analyzes the structure of the project, etc...
      - A lightweight editor is faster if we need only one file
      - In reality, a lightweight editor may have plugins that allow it to have directory-level syntax analyzers, autocompleters, etc... So there is no strict border between the two
