# **Conditional Branching: if, '?'**

- When we need to perform different actions based on certain conditions, we call these conditional branches
- `if`, `else`, `else if`, and the ternary `?...:...` are used to accomplish this

## **The "`if`" Statement**

- The `if(...)` statement evaluates a condition in parenthesis and, if the result is `true`, executes a block of code:
  ```javascript
  let year = prompt(
  	'In which year was ECMAScript-2015 specification published?',
  	''
  );
  if (year === 2015) console.log('Correct!');
  ```
- If we want to execute multiple statements, wrap everything after the parenthesis in curlies `{}`:
  ```javascript
  if (year === 2015) {
  	console.log('Correct!');
  	console.log('Well Done!');
  }
  ```
- It is recommended to always wrap your code in curlies, even if it is only one line, for readability

## **Boolean Conversion**

- The `if(...)` statement evaluates the expression in parenthesis and converts the results to a boolean
- Let's recall the rules of type conversions:
  - A number `0`, empty BigInt `0n`, empty string `""`, `null`, `undefined`, and `NaN` evaluate to `false`. These are called **falsy values**
  - All other values evaluate to `true`. These are called **truthy values**
- The `if(...)` may contain an optional `else {...}` block, which executes when the condition is falsy
  ```javascript
  if (age >= 18) {
  	console.log("You're an adult!");
  } else {
  	console.log("You're not an adult..");
  }
  ```
- We can test several conditions with the `if(...) {} else if(...) {}` syntax
- The ternary(`... ? ... : ...`) operation is a short hand `if(...) {}` statement

  - The left hand operand is the condition to test
  - The middle operand is what to execute if left hand operand is `true`
  - The right operand is what to execute if the left hand operand is `false`
    ```javascript
    let isAdult = age >= 18 ? true : false;
    ```
  - You can chain these ternaries together as well

    ```javascript
    let age = 18;

    let message =
    	age < 3
    		? 'Hi, baby!'
    		: age < 18
    		? 'Hello!'
    		: age < 100
    		? 'Greetings!'
    		: 'What an usual age...';

    console.log(message);
    ```
