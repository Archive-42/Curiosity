# **Use Strict - [Code](./2.3-use-strict.js)**

- Enables new JavaScript modifications from ES5+ that are off by default so old code is not broken
- Enable by using the code `"use strict";`

## **"use strict";**

- When used at the top of a script, the whole script works the "modern" way
  - If not put at the top, it will not work
  - Only comments may appear above "use strict"
- If used at the beginning of a function, it will only affect the function it is in
- There is no directive to cancel `"use strict"`. Once it is entered, there is no going back

## **Browser Console**

- When you use the developer tools to run code, it won't `"use strict"` by default.
- If you wish to use it in the developer console, you can enter `"use strict";` at the top, and add more lines of code by going to new lines with `Shift+Enter`.

  - If this doesn't work, for example in an older browser, you can put it and your code inside of an IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression)

    ```javascript
    (function () {
    	'use strict';

    	// Your code here

    })();
    ```

## **Should We `"use strict";` ?**

- Modern JavaScript supports `classes` and `modules` - advanced language structures that enable `use strict` automatically. If we use these, we won't need to explicitly add it ourselves.
