## **Unary, Binary, Operand**

- **Operand** - What _operators_ are applied to. For instance, in the multiplication of `5 * 2`, there are two operands: `5` is the left operand and `2` is the right operand. These are sometimes called _arguments_ as well.
- **Unary** - A _unary operator_ takes a single _operand_

  - _unary negation_ `-` reverses the sign of a number
  - _unary addition_ `+` converts operand to a number

  ```javascript
  let x = 1;
  x = -x;
  console.log(x); // -1

  let str = '123';
  let num = +str;
  console.log(typeof num); // "number"
  ```

- **Binary** - An operator that has _two operands_:

```javascript
let x = 1
let y = 10;
let sum = x + y; // binary additions
let difference y - x // binary minus substracts
```

## **Math Operations**

- Addition `+`
- Subtraction `-`
- Multiplication `*`
- Division `/`
- Modulo(Remainder) `%` - The remainder of integer division
- Exponentiation `**` - raises left operand to the power of right operand

  ```javascript
  console.log(10 ** 2); // 100

  // square root is exponentiation by 1/2
  console.log(100 ** (1 / 2)); // 10

  // cubic root is exponentiation by 1/3
  console.log(8 ** (1 / 3)); // 2
  ```

## **String Concatenation With Binary `+`**

- When the `+` operator is applied to string, it merges (concatenates) them together
  ```javascript
  let firstName = 'Michael';
  let lastName = 'Shuff';
  console.log(firstName + ' ' + lastName); // "Michael Shuff"
  ```
- If any operand is a string, the other operands will be converted to a string as well
  ```javascript
  console.log(1 + '2'); // '12'
  ```
- The operators work one after another, which means addition may happen before concatenation depending on the order:
  ```javascript
  console.log(5 + 5 + '1'); // 101
  ```
- The binary `+` is the only operator that works this way with strings, other operators attempt to convert data types to numbers

## **Numeric Conversion With Unary `+`**

- The `+` operator applied to a single operand is the unary `+`
- Does nothing to numbers
- If the operator is not a number, it attempts to convert it to a number

  ```javascript
  let x = 1;
  console.log(+x); // stays 1, no effect on numbers

  let y = -2;
  console.log(+y); // stays -2, no effect on numbers

  // Converts non-numbers
  console.log(+true); // 1
  console.log(+false); // 0
  console.log(+''); // 0
  console.log(+'123'); // 123, number now
  ```

- In effect, it does the same thing as the `Number(value)` function, but is shorter syntax
- Very useful for strings

  ```javascript
  let apples = '2';
  let oranges = '3';

  console.log(apples + oranges); // "23"
  console.log(+apples + +oranges); // 5

  // same as:
  console.log(Number(apples) + Number(oranges)); // 5
  ```

- From a mathematicians standpoint, the abundance of `+`'s may seem strange, but for a programmer, this makes perfect sense
- The unary `+` are applied to the values before the binary `+`, due to _higher precedence_

## **Operator Precedence**

- If an expression has more than one operator, the execution order will happen based on **precedence**, also known as priority order
- From school, we know the `*` has higher precedence than the `+` operator
  - `1 + 2 * 2` === `1 + (2 * 2) = 5`
- Parenthesis `()` override any precedence, allowing us to change execution order
  - `(1 + 2) * 2 = 3 * 2 = 6`
- There are many operators in JavaScript. Every operator has a corresponding precedence number. The large numbers execute first.
  - If the precedence is the same, it executes left-to-right

## **Precedence Order Chart**

|                |                                         |                   | `...&=...`               |
|                |                                         |                   | `...^=...`               |

| **1**          | **Comma/Sequence**                      | **left-to-right** | `..., ...`               |

## **Assignment**

- Note that assignment `=` is also an operator
- Because it is an operator, it returns a value
- All operators return a value

## **Chaining Assignments**

- Another interesting feature is chaining assignments

  ```javascript
  let a, b, c;
  a = b = c = 2 + 2;

  console.log(a); // 4
  console.log(b); // 4
  console.log(c); // 4
  ```

- Chained assignments evaluate from right-to-left

## **Modify-In-Place**

- We often need to apply an operator to a variable and store the result in the same variable
  ```javascript
  let n = 2;
  n = n + 5;
  n = n * 2;
  ```
- We can use shorthand operators to do the same thing:
  ```javascript
  let n = 2;
  n += 5;
  n *= 2;
  ```
- Shorthand exists for all operations: `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`, `**=`
- These operations have the same precedence as assignment, so they tend to run after other operations:
  ```javascript
  let n = 2;
  n *= 3 + 5; // Same as n = n * (3 + 5)
  ```

## **Increment/Decrement**

- Increasing or decreasing a number by one is among the most common numerical operations, so we have operators for it
  - **Increment `++`** increases a variable by 1
  - **Decrement `--`** decreases a variable by 1
  - These can only be used on variables
- These come in _prefix form(`--..., ++...`)_ and _postfix form(`...--, ...++`)_
  - Prefix form increases/decreases the variable and then returns it
  - Postfix form returns the variable, then increases/decreases it
  ```javascript
  let a = 1;
  let b = a++; // b = 1, a = 2
  let c = ++b; // c = 2, b = 2
  let d = c--; // d = 2, c = 1
  let e = --d; // e = 1, d = 1
  ```
- These can be used in expressions as well, their precedence is higher than most operations, so they'll happen first

## **Bitwise Operators**

- Bitwise operators treat arguments as 32-bit integer numbers and work on the level of their binary representation
- These are not JS specific, they are supported in most programming languages
- **Operators:**
  - AND(`&&`)
  - OR(`|`)
  - XOR(`^`)
  - NOT(`^`)
  - LEFT SHIFT(`<<`)
  - RIGHT SHIFT(`>>`)
  - ZERO-FILL RIGHT SHIFT(`>>>`)
- These are used very rarely, when we need to fiddle with numbers on the lowest level. They are more useful in cryptography than web development

## **Comma**

- The comma operator (`,`) is one of the rarest and most unusual operators. Sometimes it is used to write shorter code, so it's important to know how it works

- It allows us to evaluate several expressions, dividing them with a comma, each is evaluated, but only the result of the last one is returned
  ```javascript
  let a = (1 + 2, 3 + 4);
  console.log(a); // 7 (3 + 4);
  ```
  - Here, the first expression `1 + 2` is evaluated and the result is thrown away, then `3 + 4` is evaluated and returned.
  - Comma has a very low precedence, lower than `=`, so parenthesis are important in the example above.
  - Without them: `a = 1 + 2, 3 + 4` evaluates the `+` first, summing the numbers into `a = 3, 7`, then the assignment operator `=` assigns `a = 3`, and the rest is ignored. It's like `(a = 1 + 2), 3 + 4`
- Why do we need an operator that throws everything away except the last expression? Sometimes people use it in more complex constructs to put several actions in one line:
  ```javascript
  // three operations in one line
  for (a = 1, b = 3, c = a * b; a < 10; a++) {
    ...
  }
  ```
