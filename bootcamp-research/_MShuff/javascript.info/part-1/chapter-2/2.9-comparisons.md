# **Comparisons** - **[Code](./2.9-comparisons.js)**

   1. [**Logical Operators**:](#logical-operators)
   2. [**String Comparison**](#string-comparison)
   3. [**Comparison of Different Types**](#comparison-of-different-types)
   4. [**Strict Equality**](#strict-equality)
   5. [**Comparison with `null` and `undefined`**](#comparison-with-null-and-undefined)

- Comparisons are just like in math, and return a boolean.

## **Logical Operators**:

- _Greater Than:_ `>`
- _Less Than:_ `<`
- _Greater Than or Equal To_: `>=`
- _Less Than or Equal To:_ `<=`
- _Equality:_ `==`
  - This will attempt to convert types before testing so `5 == '5'` will be true, even though one is a number and the other is a string
- _No Equality:_ `!=`
  - Will also attempt type coercion
- _Strict Equality:_ `===`
  - Left operand and right operand MUST be same type. No type coercion
- _Strict Inequality:_ `!==`
  - Left operand and right operand MUST be same type. No type coercion

```javascript
// Examples
console.log(2 > 1); // true
console.log(2 == '2'); // true because we use double equals
console.log(2 === '2'); // false
console.log(2 !== '2'); // true, because it's a strict equality check
```

## **String Comparison**

- To compare strings, JS uses the so-called _dictionary/lexiographical_ order, letter by letter
  ```javascript
  console.log('Z' > 'A'); // true
  console.log('Glow' > 'Glee'); // true
  console.log('Bee' > 'Be'); // true
  ```
- Uppercase characters are less than Lowercase characters, because their code is before lowercase:
  ```javascript
  console.log('Z' > 'z'); // false
  ```
- The algorithm to compare two strings is simple:
  1. Compare the first character of both strings
     1. If the first character from the first string is greater/less than the other string, then the first string is greater/less than the 2nd, if not...
  2. Compare the second character of both strings the same way
  3. Repeat until the end of either string
  4. If both strings end at the same length, then they are equal. If they have different lengths, the longer string is greater

## **Comparison of Different Types**

- When comparing values of different types, JS converts the values to numbers:
  ```javascript
  console.log('2' > 1); // true, string '2' becomes number 2
  console.log('01' == 1); // true, string '01' becomes number 1
  ```
- For boolean values, `true` becomes `1`, and `false` becomes `0`
  ```javascript
  console.log(true == 1); // true
  console.log(false == 0); // true
  ```
- It is possible that at the same time two values are equal but one is `true` as a boolean and one is `false`:

  ```javascript
  let a = 0;
  console.log(Boolean(a)); // false
  let b = '0';
  console.log(Boolean(b)); // true

  // With double equals, b will be converted to 0, so it
  console.log(a == b); // true!
  ```

## **Strict Equality**

- A regular equality check (`==`) has a problem. It can not differentiate `0` from `false`
  ```javascript
  console.log(0 == false); // true
  console.log('' == false); // true
  ```
- This happens because operands of different types are converted to numbers by the equality operator (`==`).
- **A strict equality operator (`===`) checks the equality without type conversion**
  ```javascript
  console.log(0 === false); // false
  ```

## **Comparison with `null` and `undefined`**

- There is some non-intuitive behavior with `null` and `undefined` compared to other values
- ### For a **strict equality check:**
  - The values are different because they're different types:
  ```javascript
  console.log(null === undefined); // false
  ```
- ### For a **non-strict equality check:**
  - There's a special rule. These equal each other, but not any other value
    ```javascript
    console.log(null == undefined); // true
    ```
- ### For math and other comparisons `< > <= >=`

  - `null`/`undefined` are converted to numbers.
    - `null` becomes `0`
    - `undefined` becomes `NaN`
  - **Strange Results With `null` vs `0`**:
    ```javascript
    console.log(null > 0); // (1) false
    console.log(null == 0); // (2) false
    console.log(null >= 0); // (3) true
    ```
    - Mathematically, this is strange. The last result states that "`null` is greater than or equal to zero", so in one of the above cases it should be true, but it's not.
    - The reason is that an equality check `==` and comparisons `> < >= <=` operate differently:
      - Comparisons convert `null` to `0`, which is why **`(3)`** `null >= 0` is true and **`(1)`** `null > 0` is false
      - On the other hand, the equality check `==` for `undefined` and `null` is defined such that without any conversions, they equal each other and don't equal anything else. This is why **`(2)`** `null == 0` is `false`

- ### **An Incomparable `undefined`**

  - `undefined` shouldn't be compared to other values:
    ```javascript
    console.log(undefined > 0); // false (1)
    console.log(undefined < 0); // false (2)
    console.log(undefined == 0); // false (3)
    ```
    - Comparisons **`(1)`** and **`(2)`** return `false` because `undefined` gets converted to `NaN` and `NaN` is a special numeric value which returns `false` for all comparisons
    - The equality check **`(3)`** is `false` because `undefined` only equals `null` or `undefined`

- ### **Avoid Problems**
  - To avoid the majority of these issues, simply use the **strict-equality check (`===`)**
  - Treat any comparison with `null`/`undefined` except the **strict-equality check (`===`)** with care
  - Don't use comparisons `< > <= >=` with a variable that may be `null`/`undefined`, unless you're really sure of what you're doing.
