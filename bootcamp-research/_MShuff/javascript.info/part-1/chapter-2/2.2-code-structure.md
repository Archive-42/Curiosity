# **Code Structure - [Code](2.2-code-structure.js)**

- The building blocks of code:

## Statements

- Syntax constructs and commands to perform actions
- Separated by a semicolon(`;`)
- Typically written on separate line, but don't need to be

## Semicolons

- May be omitted sometimes when a line break exists via <a href="https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-automatic-semicolon-insertion">automatic semicolon insertion</a>, but really shouldn't be done

## Comments

- Comments are not interpreted by the engine and are used to describe what your code is doing, and more importantly, why you're doing it
- One line comments are preceded with a `//`
- Multi-line comments are surrounded with `/* ... */`
  - Nested multi-line comments are NOT allowed
- You can comment and uncomment code with `Ctrl + /`
