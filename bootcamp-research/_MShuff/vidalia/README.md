# vidalia
Vidalia is a random Dungeons and Dragons inspired tabletop simulator. It's friendly to new players and gives people an opportunity to enjoy the game without the need of writing their own campaign or learning the ends and outs of Dungeons and Dragons.

## The Database:
The database currently supports spells, consumables, monsters, classes, weapons, and abilities. 


## How does this work?

* New users can create an array of characters, as many as they like, and choose from a single base plot point. From there, "events" are triggered. Each event has an amount of branching events that can occur after depending on your choices. 

* Not all events are choice based, in that situation, a random selected outcome is given on each playthrough, changing your experience on each playthrough of the base campaign.

* Players health and inventory are tracked, eliminating the need for manual tracking of your own. 

* Player rolls, modifiers, and damage types are all factored in. 

* Players can interract with NPC's (Non Playable Characters) through a selection of conversation topics which can alter the path of the campaign. 

* Players can attack with their choice of abilities and weapons, all of which will be determined FOR YOU, without the need for dice.
