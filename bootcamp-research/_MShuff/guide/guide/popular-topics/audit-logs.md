# Working with Audit Logs

## Some quick background
Audit logs are a great moderation tool offered by discord to know what happened in a server, and usually by whom. At the moment, these are the only method to help you determine who the executor of a mod action was on the server. Relevant events such as `messageDelete` and `guildMemberLeave` unfortunately do not provide info on the moderation actions having triggered them; making the fetch for audit logs a necessity.

There are quite a few cases where audit logs may be used, this guide will limit itself to the most common use cases. For more information on audit logs, feel free to consult the [relevant discord api page](https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/audit-log).

::: warning
It is crucial that you first understand two details about audit logs:
1) They are not guaranteed to arrive when you expect them (if at all).
2) There is no event which triggers when an audit log is created.
:::

Let us start by looking quickly at the `fetchAuditLogs` method and how we want to work with it. Similarly to many djs methods, it returns a promise containing what we really want, the GuildAuditLogs object. In most cases, only the `entries` property will be of interest, as that is where a collection of GuildAuditLogsEntry objects are held, and consequently the information we usually want. You can always take a look at the options [in the djs docs](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/class/Guild?scrollTo=fetchAuditLogs).

In the following examples, a very simple case for some auditLog types will be explored. Some basic error handling is performed but these code segments are by no means fool proof and are meant to teach you how fetching audit logs work. For a rigorous system you will most likely need to expand on the examples based on your own goals.

## Who deleted a message?
Let us dive right into it with probably the most common use of audit logs; understanding who deleted any given message in a discord server.

::: warning
At the moment of writing this, discord does not emit an audit log if the person who deleted the message is a bot deleting a single message, or is the author of the message itself.
:::

For now we will look only at the `messageDelete` event. Let us start off with defining a basic trial code for this task.

```js
const Discord = require('discord.js');
const client = new Discord.Client();

client.once('ready', () => {
	console.log('Ready!');
});

client.on('messageDelete', message => {
	console.log(`A message by ${message.author.tag} was deleted, but we don't know by who yet.`);
});

client.login('your-token-goes-here');
```

So far nothing should seem new or complicated, we get the message deleted event, and log that a message was removed from a channel. We could make use of more information from the message object, but that is left as an exercise for the reader.

For our interests we are going to set a fetch limit of 1, and only care about the type `MESSAGE_DELETE`.

Placing this into the previous code, we get the following. Note that we will also make the function async to make use of `await`. As well we will make sure to ignore DMs.

```js
client.on('messageDelete', async message => {
	// ignore direct messages
	if (!message.guild) return;
	const fetchedLogs = await message.guild.fetchAuditLogs({
		limit: 1,
		type: 'MESSAGE_DELETE',
	});
	// Since we only have 1 audit log entry in this collection, we can simply grab the first one
	const deletionLog = fetchedLogs.entries.first();

	// Let's perform a coherence check here and make sure we got *something*
	if (!deletionLog) return console.log(`A message by ${message.author.tag} was deleted, but no relevant audit logs were found.`);

	// We now grab the user object of the person who deleted the message
	// Let us also grab the target of this action to double check things
	const { executor, target } = deletionLog;


	// And now we can update our output with a bit more information
	// We will also run a check to make sure the log we got was for the same author's message
	if (target.id === message.author.id) {
		console.log(`A message by ${message.author.tag} was deleted by ${executor.tag}.`);
	}	else {
		console.log(`A message by ${message.author.tag} was deleted, but we don't know by who.`);
	}
});
```

With this we now have a very simple logger telling us who deleted a message authored by another person.

## Who kicked a user?

Similarly to the `messageDelete` case, we will start with a bare-bones bot looking, this time, at the `guildMemberRemove` event.

```js
const Discord = require('discord.js');
const client = new Discord.Client();

client.once('ready', () => {
	console.log('Ready!');
});

client.on('guildMemberRemove', member => {
	console.log(`${member.user.tag} left the guild... but was it of their own free will?`);
});

client.login('your-token-goes-here');
```

We will again fetch audit logs while limiting ourselves to 1 entry, and looking at the `MEMBER_KICK` type.

```js
client.on('guildMemberRemove', async member => {
	const fetchedLogs = await member.guild.fetchAuditLogs({
		limit: 1,
		type: 'MEMBER_KICK',
	});
	// Since we only have 1 audit log entry in this collection, we can simply grab the first one
	const kickLog = fetchedLogs.entries.first();

	// Let's perform a coherence check here and make sure we got *something*
	if (!kickLog) return console.log(`${member.user.tag} left the guild, most likely of their own will.`);

	// We now grab the user object of the person who kicked our member
	// Let us also grab the target of this action to double check things
	const { executor, target } = kickLog;

	// And now we can update our output with a bit more information
	// We will also run a check to make sure the log we got was for the same kicked member
	if (target.id === member.id) {
		console.log(`${member.user.tag} left the guild; kicked by ${executor.tag}?`);
	} else {
		console.log(`${member.user.tag} left the guild, audit log fetch was inconclusive.`);
	}
});
```

## Who banned a user?

The logic for this will be very similar to the above kick example, with the exception that this time we have an event specifically for guild bans, that is `guildBanAdd`. Starting with a skeleton code, we have the following.

```js
const Discord = require('discord.js');
const client = new Discord.Client();

client.once('ready', () => {
	console.log('Ready!');
});

client.on('guildBanAdd', async (guild, user) => {
	console.log(`${user.tag} got hit with the swift hammer of justice in the guild ${guild.name}.`);
});

client.login('your-token-goes-here');
```

As was the case in the previous examples, we can see what happened, to whom it happened, but not who executed the action. Enter once again audit logs where we will limit ourselves to 1 entry, and looking at the `MEMBER_BAN_ADD` type. Our `guildBanAdd` listener then becomes.

```js
client.on('guildBanAdd', async (guild, user) => {
	const fetchedLogs = await guild.fetchAuditLogs({
		limit: 1,
		type: 'MEMBER_BAN_ADD',
	});
	// Since we only have 1 audit log entry in this collection, we can simply grab the first one
	const banLog = fetchedLogs.entries.first();

	// Let's perform a coherence check here and make sure we got *something*
	if (!banLog) return console.log(`${user.tag} was banned from ${guild.name} but no audit log could be found.`);

	// We now grab the user object of the person who banned the user
	// Let us also grab the target of this action to double check things
	const { executor, target } = banLog;

	// And now we can update our output with a bit more information
	// We will also run a check to make sure the log we got was for the same kicked member
	if (target.id === user.id) {
		console.log(`${user.tag} got hit with the swift hammer of justice in the guild ${guild.name}, wielded by the mighty ${executor.tag}`);
	} else {
		console.log(`${user.tag} got hit with the swift hammer of justice in the guild ${guild.name}, audit log fetch was inconclusive.`);
	}
});
```
