# Additional features

::: tip
This page is a follow-up and bases its code off of [the previous page](/command-handling/dynamic-commands.md).
:::

The command handler you've been building so far doesn't do much aside from dynamically load and execute commands. Those two things alone are great, but definitely not the only things you want. Before diving into it, let's do some quick refactoring in preparation.

```diff
	const args = message.content.slice(prefix.length).trim().split(/ +/);
-	const command = args.shift().toLowerCase();
+	const commandName = args.shift().toLowerCase();

-	if (!client.commands.has(command)) return;
+	if (!client.commands.has(commandName)) return;
+
+	const command = client.commands.get(commandName);

	try {
-		client.commands.get(command).execute(message, args);
+		command.execute(message, args);
	}
```

In this short (but necessary) refactor, you:

1. Renamed the original `command` variable to `commandName` (to be descriptive about what it actually is, and so that you can name one of our variables as `command` later).
2. Changed the following `if` statement appropriately.
3. Made a variable named `command` which is the actual command object.
4. Changed the line inside the `try/catch` statement to use the `command` variable instead.

Now you can start adding features!

## Required arguments

For this section, we'll be using the `args-info.js` command as an example. If you chose to keep it, it should look like this now:

```js
module.exports = {
	name: 'args-info',
	description: 'Information about the arguments provided.',
	execute(message, args) {
		if (!args.length) {
			return message.channel.send(`You didn't provide any arguments, ${message.author}!`);
		} else if (args[0] === 'foo') {
			return message.channel.send('bar');
		}

		message.channel.send(`Arguments: ${args}\nArguments length: ${args.length}`);
	},
};
```

This is fine if you only have a few commands that require arguments. However, if you plan on making a lot of commands and don't want to copy & paste that `if` statement each time, it'd be a smart idea to change that check into something simpler.

Here are the changes you'll be making:

```diff
+	args: true,
	execute(message, args) {
-		if (!args.length) {
-			return message.channel.send(`You didn't provide any arguments, ${message.author}!`);
-		}
-		else if (args[0] === 'foo') {
+		if (args[0] === 'foo') {
			return message.channel.send('bar');
		}
		
		message.channel.send(`Arguments: ${args}\nArguments length: ${args.length}`);
	},
```

And then in your main file:

```diff
	const command = client.commands.get(commandName);
+
+	if (command.args && !args.length) {
+		return message.channel.send(`You didn't provide any arguments, ${message.author}!`);
+	}
+
```

Now whenever you set `args` to `true` in one of your command files, it'll perform this check and supply feedback if necessary.

### Expected command usage

It's good UX (user experience) to let the user know that a command requires arguments when they don't provide any (it also prevents your code from breaking). Letting them know what kind of arguments are expected is even better.

Here's a simple implementation of such a thing. For this example, pretend you have a `!role` command, where the first argument is the user to give the role, and the second argument is the name of the role to give them.

In your `role.js` file:

```diff
	args: true,
+	usage: '<user> <role>',
	execute(message, args) {
```

In your main file:

```diff
	if (command.args && !args.length) {
-		return message.channel.send(`You didn't provide any arguments, ${message.author}!`);
+		let reply = `You didn't provide any arguments, ${message.author}!`;
+
+		if (command.usage) {
+			reply += `\nThe proper usage would be: \`${prefix}${command.name} ${command.usage}\``;
+		}
+
+		return message.channel.send(reply);
	}
```

Use an `if` statement to check if the `usage` property exists (and is truthy) first, so that you don't accidentally end up with `undefined` in the reply string (in the case that you forget to properly supply the property in your command file, or some similar incident). A simple precaution such as this can greatly improve the user experience.

## Guild only commands

Some commands are meant to be used only inside servers and won't work whatsoever in DMs. A prime example of this would be a kick command. You can add a property to the necessary commands to determine whether or not it should be only available outside of servers.

In the kick command you created in an earlier chapter, make the following changes:

```diff
module.exports = {
	name: 'kick',
	description: 'Kick a user from the server.',
+	guildOnly: true,
```

And in your main file, above the args checking line, add this in:

```js
if (command.guildOnly && message.channel.type === 'dm') {
	return message.reply('I can\'t execute that command inside DMs!');
}
```

Now when you try to use the kick command inside a DM, you'll get the appropriate response which will also prevent your bot from throwing an error.

<div is="discord-messages">
	<discord-message author="User" avatar="djs">
		!kick
	</discord-message>
	<discord-message author="Tutorial Bot" avatar="blue" :bot="true">
		I can't execute that command inside DMs!
	</discord-message>
</div>

## Cooldowns

Spam is something you generally want to avoid - especially if one of your commands requires calls to other APIs, or takes a bit of time to build/send. This is also a very common feature bot developers want to integrate into their projects, so let's get started on that!

You'll be using the ping command to test this on. Add in the following bit of code:

```diff
module.exports = {
	name: 'ping',
+	cooldown: 5,
	execute(message) {
		message.channel.send('Pong.');
	},
};
```

This is the amount (in seconds) that the user will have to wait before being able to properly use that command again. You'll be using Collections again to store what you need.

In your main file, add in this line (preferably somewhere above your `ready` event):

```js
const cooldowns = new Discord.Collection();
```

Again in your main file, directly above the `try/catch`, add in the following:

```js
if (!cooldowns.has(command.name)) {
	cooldowns.set(command.name, new Discord.Collection());
}

const now = Date.now();
const timestamps = cooldowns.get(command.name);
const cooldownAmount = (command.cooldown || 3) * 1000;

if (timestamps.has(message.author.id)) {
	// ...
}
```

You check if the `cooldowns` Collection has the command set in it yet. If not, then add it in. Next, 3 variables are created:

1. A variable with the current timestamp.
2. A variable that `.get()`s the Collection for the triggered command.
3. A variable that gets the necessary cooldown amount. If you don't supply it in your command file, it'll default to 3. Afterwards, convert it to the proper amount of milliseconds.

After that, create a simple `if` statement to check if the `timestamps` Collection has the author ID in it yet.

Continuing with your current setup, this is the complete `if` statement:

```js
if (timestamps.has(message.author.id)) {
	const expirationTime = timestamps.get(message.author.id) + cooldownAmount;

	if (now < expirationTime) {
		const timeLeft = (expirationTime - now) / 1000;
		return message.reply(`please wait ${timeLeft.toFixed(1)} more second(s) before reusing the \`${command.name}\` command.`);
	}
}
```

Since the `timestamps` Collection has the author ID in it, you `.get()` it and then sum it up with the `cooldownAmount` variable, in order to get the correct expiration timestamp. You then check to see if it's actually expired or not.

If the `expirationTime` has not passed, you return a message letting the user know how much time is left until they can use that command again. As you will see shortly, the author ID should be deleted from the `timestamps` Collection upon expiration, but you should take this extra precaution to avoid potential UX problems.

Finally, if the `timestamps` Collection doesn't have the message author's ID (or if the author ID did not get deleted as planned), `.set()` the author ID with the current timestamp and create a `setTimeout()` to automatically delete it after the cooldown period has passed:

```js
timestamps.set(message.author.id, now);
setTimeout(() => timestamps.delete(message.author.id), cooldownAmount);
```

## Command aliases

It's a good idea to allow users to trigger your commands in more than one way; it gives them the freedom of choosing what to send and may even make some command names easier to remember. Luckily, setting up aliases for your commands is quite simple.

For this bit of the guide, we'll be using the avatar command as a target. Around Discord, your profile picture is referred to as an "avatar" - however, not everyone calls it that. Some people prefer "icon" or "pfp" (profile picture). With that in mind, let's update the avatar command to allow all 3 of those triggers.

Open your `avatar.js` file and add in the following line:

```diff
module.exports = {
	name: 'avatar',
+	aliases: ['icon', 'pfp'],
```

The `aliases` property should always contain an array of strings. In your main file, here are the changes you'll need to make:

```diff
-	if (!client.commands.has(commandName)) return;
-
-	const command = client.commands.get(commandName);
+	const command = client.commands.get(commandName)
+		|| client.commands.find(cmd => cmd.aliases && cmd.aliases.includes(commandName));
+
+	if (!command) return;
```

Making those two small changes, you get this:

<div is="discord-messages">
	<discord-message author="User" avatar="djs">
		!avatar <mention :highlight="true">User</mention>
	</discord-message>
	<discord-message author="Tutorial Bot" avatar="blue" :bot="true">
		User's avatar:
		https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/328037144868290560/1cc0a3b14aec3499632225c708451d67.png
		<br />
		<img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/328037144868290560/1cc0a3b14aec3499632225c708451d67.png" alt="" />
	</discord-message>
	<discord-message author="User" avatar="djs">
		!icon <mention :highlight="true">User</mention>
	</discord-message>
	<discord-message author="Tutorial Bot" avatar="blue" :bot="true">
		User's avatar:
		https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/328037144868290560/1cc0a3b14aec3499632225c708451d67.png

	</discord-message>
</div>

## A dynamic help command

If you don't use a framework or command handler for your projects, you'll have a tough time setting up an always up-to-date help command. Luckily, that's not the case here. Start by creating a new command file inside your `commands` folder and populate it as you normally would.

```js
module.exports = {
	name: 'help',
	description: 'List all of my commands or info about a specific command.',
	aliases: ['commands'],
	usage: '[command name]',
	cooldown: 5,
	execute(message, args) {
		// ...
	},
};
```

You're going to need your prefix variable a couple times inside this command, so make sure to require that at the very top of the file (outside of the `module.exports` bit).

```js
const { prefix } = require('../config.json');
```

Inside the `execute()` function, set up some variables and an if/else statement to determine whether it should display a list of all the command names or only information about a specific command.

```js
const data = [];
const { commands } = message.client;

if (!args.length) {
	// ...
}

// ...
```

You can use `.push()` on the `data` variable to append the info you want and then DM it to the message author once you're done.

Inside the if statement, this is what you'll need:

```js
data.push('Here\'s a list of all my commands:');
data.push(commands.map(command => command.name).join(', '));
data.push(`\nYou can send \`${prefix}help [command name]\` to get info on a specific command!`);

return message.author.send(data, { split: true })
	.then(() => {
		if (message.channel.type === 'dm') return;
		message.reply('I\'ve sent you a DM with all my commands!');
	})
	.catch(error => {
		console.error(`Could not send help DM to ${message.author.tag}.\n`, error);
		message.reply('it seems like I can\'t DM you! Do you have DMs disabled?');
	});
```

There's nothing really complex here; all you do is append some strings, `.map()` over the `commands` Collection, and add an additional string to let the user know how to trigger information about a specific command.

Since help messages can get messy, you'll be DMing it to the message author instead of posting it in the requested channel. However, there is something very important you should consider: the possibility of not being able to DM the user, whether it be that they have DMs disabled on that server or overall, or they have the bot blocked. For that reason, you should `.catch()` it and let them know.

::: tip
If you weren't already aware, `.send()` takes 2 parameters: the content to send, and the message options to pass in. You can read about the `MessageOptions` type <branch version="11.x" inline>[here](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/v11/typedef/MessageOptions)</branch><branch version="12.x" inline>[here](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/typedef/MessageOptions)</branch>. Using `split: true` here will automatically split our help message into 2 or more messages in the case that it exceeds the 2,000 character limit.
:::

::: tip
Because the `data` variable is an array, you can take advantage of discord.js' functionality where it will `.join()` any array sent with a `\n` character. If you prefer to not rely on that in the chance that it changes in the future, you can simply append `.join('\n')` to the end of that yourself.
:::

Below the `if (!args.length)` statement is where you'll send the help message for the command they specified.

```js
const name = args[0].toLowerCase();
const command = commands.get(name) || commands.find(c => c.aliases && c.aliases.includes(name));

if (!command) {
	return message.reply('that\'s not a valid command!');
}

data.push(`**Name:** ${command.name}`);

if (command.aliases) data.push(`**Aliases:** ${command.aliases.join(', ')}`);
if (command.description) data.push(`**Description:** ${command.description}`);
if (command.usage) data.push(`**Usage:** ${prefix}${command.name} ${command.usage}`);

data.push(`**Cooldown:** ${command.cooldown || 3} second(s)`);

message.channel.send(data, { split: true });
```

Once you get the command based off the name or alias they gave, you can start `.push()`ing what you need into the `data` variable. Not all commands will have descriptions, aliases, or usage strings, so you use an if statement for each of those to append them conditionally. After that, send back all the relevant information.

At the end of it all, you should be getting this as a result:

<div is="discord-messages">
	<discord-message author="User" avatar="djs">
		!help
	</discord-message>
	<discord-message author="Tutorial Bot" avatar="blue" :bot="true">
		Here's a list of all my commands:
		args-info, avatar, beep, help, kick, ping, prune, server, user-info	<br>
		You can send `!help [command name]` to get info on a specific command!
	</discord-message>
	<discord-message author="User" avatar="djs">
		!help avatar
	</discord-message>
	<discord-message author="Tutorial Bot" avatar="blue" :bot="true">
		**Name:** avatar <br>
		**Aliases:** icon,pfp <br>
		**Description:** Get the avatar URL of the tagged user(s), or your own avatar. <br>
		**Cooldown:** 3 second(s)
	</discord-message>
</div>

No more manually editing your help command! If you aren't completely satisfied with how it looks, you can always adjust it to your liking later.

::: tip
If you want to add categories or other information to your commands you can simply add properties reflecting it to your `module.exports`. If you only want to show a subset of commands remember that `commands` is a Collection you can <branch version="11.x" inline>[filter](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/v11/class/Collection?scrollTo=filter)</branch><branch version="12.x" inline>[filter](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/collection/master/class/Collection?scrollTo=filter)</branch> to fit your specific needs!

## Reloading commands

When writing your commands, you may find it tedious to restart your bot every time you want to test even the slightest change in your code. However, if you have a command handler, reloading commands can be done with a single bot command.

Create a new command file and paste in the usual format:

```js
module.exports = {
	name: 'reload',
	description: 'Reloads a command',
	execute(message, args) {
		// ...
	},
};
```

In this command, you will be using a command name or alias as the only argument. First off, you need to check if the command you want to reload exists. This can be done in a similar fashion as getting a command in your main file.  
Note that you can skip the first line if you use the [argument checker](/command-handling/adding-features.html#required-arguments) from above:

```js
if (!args.length) return message.channel.send(`You didn't pass any command to reload, ${message.author}!`);
const commandName = args[0].toLowerCase();
const command = message.client.commands.get(commandName)
	|| message.client.commands.find(cmd => cmd.aliases && cmd.aliases.includes(commandName));

if (!command) return message.channel.send(`There is no command with name or alias \`${commandName}\`, ${message.author}!`);
```

:::tip
A lot of library specific structures have `client` as a property. That means you don't have to pass the client reference as a parameter to commands to access for example `client.guilds` or `client.commands`, but can directly access the respective properties directly from the `message` object, as shown in the snippet above.
:::

Now, in theory, all there is to do, is to delete the previous command from `client.commands` and require the file again. In practice though, you cannot do this that easily as `require()` caches the file. If you were to require it again, you would simply load the previously cached file without any of your changes. In order to remove the file from the cache, you need to add the following line to your code:

```js
delete require.cache[require.resolve(`./${command.name}.js`)];
```

After removing the command from the cache, all you have to do is require the file again and add the freshly loaded command to `client.commands`:

```js
try {
	const newCommand = require(`./${command.name}.js`);
	message.client.commands.set(newCommand.name, newCommand);
} catch (error) {
	console.error(error);
	message.channel.send(`There was an error while reloading a command \`${command.name}\`:\n\`${error.message}\``);
}
```

The snippet above uses a `try/catch` block to load the command file and add it to `client.commands`. In case of an error it will log the full error to console and notify the user about it with the error's message component `error.message`. Note the you never actually delete the command from the commands collection, and instead just overwrite it. This prevents you from deleting a command, and ending up with no command at all after a failed `require()` call, as each use of the reload command checks that collection again.

The last slight improvement you might want to add to the try block is sending a message if the reload was successful:

```js
message.channel.send(`Command \`${command.name}\` was reloaded!`);
```

## Conclusion 

At this point of the guide, you should now have a command handler with some very basic (but useful) features! If you see fit, you can expand upon the current structure to make something even better and easier for you to use in the future.
