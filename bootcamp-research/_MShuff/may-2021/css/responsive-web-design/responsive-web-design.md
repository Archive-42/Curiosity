# Responsive Web Design Notes

## Units of Measurement

- `rem`, `em`, and `%` are some of the most responsive and useful length measurements for responsive design
  - `rem`: size relative to the root element of the page
  - `em`: size relative to the parent element
  - `%`: size relative to the parent element
- `vw` and `vh` (viewport width, viewport height) are also useful in responsive web design
