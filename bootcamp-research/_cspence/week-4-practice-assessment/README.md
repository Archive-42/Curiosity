# Selection, Event Handling, and Storage Practice Assessment Project

Open the "index.html" file in your browser. The HTML page contains a list of
tests that you must make pass to complete this portion of the practice
assessment.

For example, the first test reads:

**PROBLEM 1: Make the circle blue**

> - Button `id`: `make-circle-blue`
> - Div `id`: `blue-circumference-circle`

> When you click the button below, you should add the "blue" CSS class to the
> circle with the blue circumference. Adding the "blue" CSS class will turn the
> inside of the circle blue. Write code in the "your-code.js" file to make that
> happen.

Open "your-code.js" and write the code to make that happen. If you have written
the correct code, then you can click the button and see the circle turn blue.

**Don't forget to refresh your page when you make changes in the JavaScript
code!**

Make all of the tests pass by writing code in "your-code.js" and interacting
with the test in the way specified.
