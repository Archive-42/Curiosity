  <h1 id="improving-your-profile-using-github">Improving Your Profile Using GitHub</h1>
  <p>By now you are likely familiar with certain aspects of GitHub. You know how to
    create repos and add and commit code, but there is much, much more that GitHub
    can do.</p>
  <p>GitHub is an online community of software engineers - a place where we not only
    house our code, but share ideas, express feedback, gain inspiration, and present
    ourselves as competent, qualified software engineers. Yes, this is a place to
    manage version control and collaborate on projects, but in this module we are
    going to discuss how to harness the power of GitHub to your advantage.</p>
  <p>Aside from your actual code repositories, there are several other sections that
    represent who you are as a developer.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Followers and Following</strong>: Think of this as your “friends’ list on GitHub.
      If you see a social media profile of a person with two friends, what are you
      going to think? Though you’re not expected to have hundreds of followers on
      GitHub, you should follow your peers and encourage them to follow you to show
      industry engineers that there are people who would vouch for your skillset.</li>
    <li><strong>Stars</strong>: These are the “likes” on your GitHub profile. Similar to
      encouraging others to follow you and following them, you should also “star”
      their popular repositories. By the end of the curriculum, you should have
      several stars on each of your portfolio projects.</li>
    <li><strong>Green Gardens</strong>: This is birds-eye view of your “newsfeed” if your newsfeed
      reflected the number of commits that you were making. If you are very active
      on GitHub, your activity squares, AKA “green gardens” will be verdant and
      green. This tells anyone who views your profile that you are actively coding
      and engaged with your identity as a software engineer. However, if your “green
      gardens” are not green, this suggests that you are not actively coding and
      therefore perhaps not the best candidates for a development job.</li>
    <li><strong>Photo and brief intro</strong>: This is fairly straight-forward and should mirror
      the photo from you LinkedIn. Choose a professional photo and brief description
      that highlights the fact that you are a software engineer.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Your followers, stars, green gardens, and photo represent who you are as a
    developer and should be constantly monitored and updated. It can be easy to fall
    into the trap of not pushing commits to GitHub or keeping your commits on your
    local machine - be careful to avoid these tendencies because they are
    counter-productive to your candidacy as a software engineer.</p>
  <p>Not only is GitHub as representation of you as a developer, but it is also a
    place to present proposals, recaps, and provide additional project context. Two
    features that you will soon become familiar with are Wikis and READMEs.</p>
  <h2 id="wikis-pre-project">Wikis (pre-project)</h2>
  <p>Wikis are features of PUBLIC repositories on GitHub and are where your design
    documents, explanation of technologies used and insight into what your repo
    contains will live.</p>
  <p>Wikis are created at the beginning of any significant project and should be
    updated as your project evolves.</p>
  <p>To create or update your repository’s Wiki, click on the “Wiki” tab in your repo
    header and click “Edit” to update your home page and “New Page” to add a new
    section.</p>
  <p><img
      src="https://appacademy-open-assets.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Module-Non-Technical/assets/github-repo-menu-bar-wiki.png"
      alt="Wiki tab on GitHub"></p>
  <p>Best practices for Wiki creation:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>List of technologies in a visually accessible place</li>
    <li>Separate design documents into their own sections</li>
    <li>Write clearly and concisely - grammar and spelling matters!</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Design documents will become very important when you begin your projects, but
    for now just know that you will spend time creating a solid Wiki in order to
    facilitate a smooth development process. One of the most important aspects of
    your Wiki will be the outline of your project’s features and the <strong>minimum
      viable product</strong> (MVP).</p>
  <p>As you begin any project, you will consider what constitutes a “final product”
    and break down features into bite-sized “minimum viable products.” For example,
    if you intend to create an a/A version of Twitter, your list of MVPs may
    include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Users are able to log into application</li>
    <li>Users are able to create, edit, and delete tweets</li>
    <li>Users are able to follow other users and see their tweets</li>
    <li>Users are able to like other users tweets</li>
    <li>Users are able to comment on other users tweets</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In order for your project to stay on track, it is very important to break down
    your features and tackle one MVP at a time. All of the MVPs combined result in a
    final application.</p>
  <p>Your MVP breakdown will live in your project’s Wiki and is subject to evolution.
    As your project comes to life, your MVPs may merge, divide, or become
    irrelevant. Update your Wiki as things change and continue to referring to it as
    your go through the development process.</p>
  <h2 id="readme-files-post-project">README files (post-project)</h2>
  <p>READMEs are text files that introduce and explain a project. Typically, READMEs
    are created and completed when you are ready to roll your application into
    production. READMEs should contain information about two impressive features
    that you implemented in your project, the technologies used, how to install the
    program, and anything else that makes you stand out as a software developer.</p>
  <p>Think of READMEs as the “first impression” that prospective employers,
    colleagues, and peers will have of you as a developer. You want their first
    impression to be “wow, this person is thorough and this project sounds
    interesting,” not “oh no, typos, missing instructions, and snores-galore.”</p>
  <p>When it is time to create your README, you should allocate about three hours to
    guarantee you have enough time to make your project shine.</p>
  <p><a href="http://README.html">README.md</a> files are written using markdown syntax (.md) which makes them appear
    nicely on-screen. Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text
    formatting syntax. It’s a very simple language used to create beautiful and
    presentable README and Wiki files for GitHub. There are many good resources out
    there for creating markdown documents, but here are two of our favorite:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>GitHub's guide to <a href="https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/">Mastering Markdown</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/matiassingers/awesome-readme">Repository with a collection of examples</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://stackedit.io/app#">Browser side-by-side markdown and on-screen program</a> (this is a favorite,
      code
      here and copy markdown into GitHub).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>README Best Practices</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Divide your README into distinct sections</li>
    <li>List the technologies used at the top of your README for increased visibility</li>
    <li>Include nice pictures or Gifs to show and/or demonstrate how things work</li>
    <li>Include code snippets</li>
    <li>Provide instructions for how to install project (if applicable)</li>
    <li>Include link to the live site</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id="wrap-up">Wrap up</h2>
  <p>The bottom line is that the way you represent yourself on GitHub matters! Take
    the time you need to write clearly, accurately reflect your process and
    applications, and immerse yourself in the diverse and interesting pool of
    software professionals who work and play on GitHub.</p>

  <p>It is hard to write about yourself. But, today, you need to do that. This is a
    day of starting to establish how other software developers and hiring managers
    will perceive you.</p>
  <p>Go to your GitHub profile page. Edit your profile to contain your description,
    &quot;Web-Dev (@appacademy)&quot; as your current company, your location (if you
    desire), and your Web site.</p>
  <p>Now, make a personal Web site for your GitHub profile. You can do that using
    GitHub Pages. Follow the instructions at <a
      href="https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/getting-started-with-github-pages">Getting
      Started with GitHub Pages</a> to
    create your site, add a theme, create a custom 404, and use HTTPS (if you want).</p>
  <p>Spend time writing about yourself. Like you read earlier, this is hard. But,
    tell the story of you in a way that will engage people.</p>
  <p>Now, go follow all of your class mates and star their personal Web site
    repository, if they created one.</p>
  <p>If you want to get really fancy and set up a blog, you can use a &quot;static site
    generator&quot; known as <strong>Jekyll</strong> to do that. It's a Ruby-based program; however,
    you don't need to know Ruby to use it. All you have to be able to do is use
    command line programs, something you're really getting to be a pro at! To do
    this, follow the well-documented instructions at <a
      href="https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll">Setting
      up a GitHub Pages site
      with Jekyll</a>.</p>
