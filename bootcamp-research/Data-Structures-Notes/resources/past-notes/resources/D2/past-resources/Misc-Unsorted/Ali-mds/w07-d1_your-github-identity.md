# GitHub Profile and Projects Objectives

GitHub is a powerful platform that hiring managers and other developers can use
to see how you create software.

* You will be able to participate in the social aspects of GitHub by starring
  repositories, following other developers, and reviewing your followers
* You will be able to use Markdown to write code snippets in your README files
* You will craft your GitHub profile and contribute throughout the course by
  keeping your "gardens green"
* You will be able to identify the basics of a good Wiki entries for proposals
  and minimum viable products
* You will be able to identify the basics of a good project README that includes
  technologies at the top, images, descriptions and code snippetsing managers and other developers can use

# Improving Your Profile Using GitHub

By now you are likely familiar with certain aspects of GitHub. You know how to
create repos and add and commit code, but there is much, much more that GitHub
can do.

GitHub is an online community of software engineers - a place where we not only
house our code, but share ideas, express feedback, gain inspiration, and present
ourselves as competent, qualified software engineers. Yes, this is a place to
manage version control and collaborate on projects, but in this module we are
going to discuss how to harness the power of GitHub to your advantage.

Aside from your actual code repositories, there are several other sections that
represent who you are as a developer.

* **Followers and Following**: Think of this as your “friends’ list on GitHub.
  If you see a social media profile of a person with two friends, what are you
  going to think? Though you’re not expected to have hundreds of followers on
  GitHub, you should follow your peers and encourage them to follow you to show
  industry engineers that there are people who would vouch for your skillset.
* **Stars**: These are the “likes” on your GitHub profile. Similar to
  encouraging others to follow you and following them, you should also “star”
  their popular repositories. By the end of the curriculum, you should have
  several stars on each of your portfolio projects.
* **Green Gardens**: This is birds-eye view of your “newsfeed” if your newsfeed
  reflected the number of commits that you were making. If you are very active
  on GitHub, your activity squares, AKA “green gardens” will be verdant and
  green. This tells anyone who views your profile that you are actively coding
  and engaged with your identity as a software engineer. However, if your “green
  gardens” are not green, this suggests that you are not actively coding and
  therefore perhaps not the best candidates for a development job.
* **Photo and brief intro**: This is fairly straight-forward and should mirror
  the photo from you LinkedIn. Choose a professional photo and brief description
  that highlights the fact that you are a software engineer.

Your followers, stars, green gardens, and photo represent who you are as a
developer and should be constantly monitored and updated. It can be easy to fall
into the trap of not pushing commits to GitHub or keeping your commits on your
local machine - be careful to avoid these tendencies because they are
counter-productive to your candidacy as a software engineer.

Not only is GitHub as representation of you as a developer, but it is also a
place to present proposals, recaps, and provide additional project context. Two
features that you will soon become familiar with are Wikis and READMEs.

## Wikis (pre-project)

Wikis are features of PUBLIC repositories on GitHub and are where your design
documents, explanation of technologies used and insight into what your repo
contains will live.

Wikis are created at the beginning of any significant project and should be
updated as your project evolves.

To create or update your repository’s Wiki, click on the “Wiki” tab in your repo
header and click “Edit” to update your home page and “New Page” to add a new
section.

Best practices for Wiki creation:

* List of technologies in a visually accessible place
* Separate design documents into their own sections
* Write clearly and concisely - grammar and spelling matters!

Design documents will become very important when you begin your projects, but
for now  just know that you will spend time creating a solid Wiki in order to
facilitate a smooth development process. One of the most important aspects of
your Wiki will be the outline of your project’s features and the **minimum
viable product** (MVP).

As you begin any project, you will consider what constitutes a “final product”
and break down features into bite-sized “minimum viable products.” For example,
if you intend to create an a/A version of Twitter, your list of MVPs may
include:

* Users are able to log into application
* Users are able to create, edit, and delete tweets
* Users are able to follow other users and see their tweets
* Users are able to like other users tweets
* Users are able to comment on other users tweets

In order for your project to stay on track, it is very important to break down
your features and tackle one MVP at a time. All of the MVPs combined result in a
final application.

Your MVP breakdown will live in your project’s Wiki and is subject to evolution.
As your project comes to life, your MVPs may merge, divide, or become
irrelevant. Update your Wiki as things change and continue to referring to it as
your go through the development process.

## README files (post-project)

READMEs are text files that introduce and explain a project. Typically, READMEs
are created and completed when you are ready to roll your application into
production. READMEs should contain information about two impressive features
that you implemented in your project, the technologies used, how to install the
program, and anything else that makes you stand out as a software developer.

Think of READMEs as the “first impression” that prospective employers,
colleagues, and peers will have of you as a developer. You want their first
impression to be “wow, this person is thorough and this project sounds
interesting,” not “oh no, typos, missing instructions, and snores-galore.”

When it is time to create your README, you should allocate about three hours to
guarantee you have enough time to make your project shine.

README.md files are written using markdown syntax (.md) which makes them appear
nicely on-screen. Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text
formatting syntax. It’s a very simple language used to create beautiful and
presentable README and Wiki files for GitHub. There are many good resources out
there for creating markdown documents, but here are two of our favorite:

* GitHub's guide to [Mastering Markdown]
* [Repository with a collection of examples]
* [Browser side-by-side markdown and on-screen program] (this is a favorite, code
  here and copy markdown into GitHub).

README Best Practices

* Divide your README into distinct sections
* List the technologies used at the top of your README for increased visibility
* Include nice pictures or Gifs to show and/or demonstrate how things work
* Include code snippets
* Provide instructions for how to install project (if applicable)
* Include link to the live site

## Wrap up

The bottom line is that the way you represent yourself on GitHub matters! Take
the time you need to write clearly, accurately reflect your process and
applications, and immerse yourself in the diverse and interesting pool of
software professionals who work and play on GitHub.

# Your GitHub Identity

It is hard to write about yourself. But, today, you need to do that. This is a
day of starting to establish how other software developers and hiring managers
will perceive you.

Go to your GitHub profile page. Edit your profile to contain your description,
"Web-Dev (@appacademy)" as your current company, your location (if you
desire), and your Web site.

Now, make a personal Web site for your GitHub profile. You can do that using
GitHub Pages. Follow the instructions at [Getting Started with GitHub Pages] to
create your site, add a theme, create a custom 404, and use HTTPS (if you want).

Spend time writing about yourself. Like you read earlier, this is hard. But,
tell the story of you in a way that will engage people.

Now, go follow all of your class mates and star their personal Web site
repository, if they created one.

If you want to get really fancy and set up a blog, you can use a "static site
generator" known as **Jekyll** to do that. It's a Ruby-based program; however,
you don't need to know Ruby to use it. All you have to be able to do is use
command line programs, something you're really getting to be a pro at! To do
this, follow the well-documented instructions at [Setting up a GitHub Pages site
with Jekyll].
