## Lecture: 

Review the basics of today, especially the complexity classes, common code behaviors that contribute to those complexities (nested loops lead to polynomial, etc.), and how a memo/table are used to access previously calculated values. Many students ended up being concerned about the material because they felt stuck on the minChange/leetCode problems. Reassure them that these are advanced applications of the material and the focus should be on understanding the concepts and why they are helpful in these instances (also mentioned that problems of that complexity would be more in line with a technical interview to see your thought process than they would be likely to be seen in an assessment environment).
