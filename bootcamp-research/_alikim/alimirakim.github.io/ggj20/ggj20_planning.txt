IDEA - Muunokhoi and the Elf
You play as Muunokhoi after she rescued this elf. Your goal is to figure out as much about the Elf as possible so as to find the clues to return them home. With this design, the story itself is linear, but the gameplay is full of important yet non-permanent non-truly-branching options. Think like Ace Attorney's story-telling. As a form of concrete progression, you have a 'data sheet' that you fill out slowly with the facts that you discover as you discover them. It can have lots of info, even mundane things. Examples: The elf's name, their religion, favorite food, fear, the climate of where they used to live, et cetera. You can also do some things to collect objects that may be important.
