Within two years, the town was incorporated by Denver and became an important commercial node for the growing city as it accommodated switch yards for several railroad companies in addition to powerhouses for local utility generation firms. Over 150 years later the area is now the site of the Auraria Campus, where one community college and two public universities are located. The neighborhood is also home to the Denver Nuggets basketball team, as well and the Colorado Avalanche hockey organization.

The Observatory was built in 1893 shortly after DU's relocation from central downtown to its current campus, which was once a potato farm. In the late 19th century, there was not easily accessible atomic clocks or the Internet. As such, the Observatory was one of DU's most reliable sources of revenue through selling the time to the railroads. Staff at Chamberlin did this by precisely measuring the angle above the horizon of the sun and stars and sending the result of their calculations via telegram to the nearby train station. The station would then recalibrate their clock to ensure the train was running according to schedule. Today, University Park is known for its generous elbow room and close relative proximity to the Denver Technological Center. The view plane levels out tremendously due to the single-family architecture that predominates this tract of the city. DU is within walking distance, while two major light rail stations with a park-and-ride feature can be quickly accessed by motor vehicle. Anyone desiring either an exurban feel or being within a reasonably close distance to the DTC would likely be right at home in University Park.",

No other area in the city has such a balanced genre of aesthetic flavors. On the west end resides the South Platte River, Interstate 25, Union Pacific and BNSF Railway’s Consolidated Main Line, a light rail transportation corridor, and several industrial parks. On the east end is a beautiful and distinct residential sector that offers a sharp, chromatic contrast thanks to its rich civic detail, human-scale architecture, main-street retail shopping, hundred-year-old trees, flagstone sidewalks, and presence of over one-hundred historic homes, which have earned the southeastern corner of this neighborhood an official historic area designation. Although predominately zoned industrial at the present time, the west end of Baker is undergoing rapid redevelopment thanks to the mass transit rail line. Commercial buildings here are being bought and repurposed as residential lofts, boutique office space, and mixed-use spaces. All-inclusive fitness centers, art galleries, doggie daycares, indoor paintball battlefields, and post-modern style housing stock can now be found occupying structures and land parcels that were formerly used by industrial-type businesses. The transition is integrating both east and west Baker and is establishing a consistent land-use pattern that is adding to Baker’s already-dynamic feel. On the west end of Baker is the South Broadway shopping and nightlife district, where pubs, shops, and other small businesses occupy a mile-plus-long stretch of Denver’s Lincoln/Broadway Street corridor. A rapid-service bus line also here also provides easy access to downtown Denver during peak service hours. All of these key features help Baker earn its distinction of being one of Denver’s top neighborhoods.",

Downtown Denver is additionally served by a rail transit line that originates from the eastern suburb of Aurora, while Union Station is additionally served by a rail line that begins in the mountain foothills town of Golden and passes through the western Denver suburb of Lakewood before reaching the Denver Union Station terminus. Starting 2016, the metro area’s public transit agency will begin phasing in an electrified commuter rail service for the northern suburbs of Denver. The opening of these rail lines will commence in incremental stages throughout a period of about half a decade and will provide rapid, fixed-route travel options between the Union Station neighborhood and Denver International Airport, as well as the cities of Wheat Ridge, Arvada, Westminster, Aurora, Northglenn, Thornton, and Welby. Aside from its growing multi-modal ethos, downtown Denver has one of the country’s most highly cultured social environments. The historic Colorado state capitol building is positioned at the southeastern corner of the central business district and lends a strong essence of civic pride. Many other sub-zones and sub-communities are located in both downtown Denver and the Union Station neighborhood and include the Lower Downtown nightlife and entertainment district, which is the largest in the state among the 16th Street Mall shopping district, Colorado’s number one destination for tourists.",

According to statistical data gathered by several housing search sites, Speer is the top target for apartment renters. Like Baker, this charming neighborhood is located along Denver’s South Broadway, or “SoBo,” shopping and nightlife district where a tremendous variety of eateries, clothing retailers, salons, bars, theaters, and nightclubs occupy a 14-block stretch of the Broadway/Lincoln Street corridor. Beautiful single family homes intermingle with smaller apartment communities to help bring balance to this area’s population density.",

Despite being four neighborhoods out from the Central Business District, this area tends to attract many urban professionals. Both a light rail line and Interstate 25 run along the southern edge offering direct, multi-modal access to downtown Denver and the Denver Technological Center, which are two of the Denver metropolitan area’s largest employment centers. Four different light rail stations are located either in or near the neighborhood. The athletically-inclined will appreciate living close to Washington Park itself, a local gem that draws people from all over the city with its 2.6-mile crushed-gravel running trail, eight tennis courts, year-round swimming pool, large recreation center, soccer fields, basketball courts, and volleyball pads. Due to its central location, many outdoor enthusiasts and personal wellness social-networking groups have also made Washington Park their usual rendezvous point. For post-recreational-meetup gatherings, many pubs and eateries are conveniently scattered throughout Washington Park West, with a large concentration of these establishments being located at the western limits of the neighborhood, where the southern portion of Denver’s South Broadway nightlife district is located. Also popular with the Washington Park regulars is the South Pearl Street business district, which features charming, main-street-style buildings.",

Five Points has a highly rich heritage that is made evident by its numerous stone mansions and 1880’s-era brick-construction commercial structures, many of which still bear marks of the distant past, such as their sun-worn three-story-tall painted wall advertisements, rooftop lighting rods, and wrought-iron fire escapes. Sadly, the name of this historic neighborhood is slowly falling into disuse, as many condominium developers have recently begun informally rebranding several areas of this neighborhood with contemporary-sounding designations. River North, or “RiNo”, is the name of an art district that occupies the western half of Five Points. Ballpark, a stadium and sports district, overlays the far southwest corner, while an urban infill district named Prospect abuts both Union Station and Highland on the far west end. A light rail transit line serves the eastern half of Five Points and runs along the main commercial strip of this neighborhood. Nomenclature concerns and new luxury condominiums developments aside, Five Points retains a robust sense of charm and antiquity thanks to the Welton Street nightlife corridor, which, at one point, had as many as 50 independent music theaters and taverns once frequented by a large list of famous jazz artists such as Duke Ellington, Miles Davis, Nat King Cole, and Dizzy Gillespie. With a close proximity to downtown Denver, this neighborhood also makes it an ideal location for those wishing to be near the central business district of the city.",
