  Type: Standard
  Organization: JHU Biostatistics
  Version: 1.0.0

- Class: text
  Output: In this lesson, we will discuss type I and type II errors as well as the
    closely related concepts of power and sample size calculation.

- Class: text
  Output: A type I error, also known as a false positive, is the probability of rejecting
    the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis is true. When performing a statistical
    test, the type I error rate is typically predetermined by the statistician performing
    the test and is equivalent to the significance level of the test. Type I error
    is generally represented by the Greek letter 'alpha'.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Another name for a type I error is ___________.
  AnswerChoices: beta; true positive; false negative; alpha
  CorrectAnswer: alpha
  AnswerTests: word= alpha
  Hint: Review the previous paragraph.

- Class: text
  Output: On the other hand, a type II error, also known as a false negative, is the
    probability of failing to reject the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis
    is false. Notice that we intentionally avoid saying that one 'accepts the null
    hypothesis' in favor of saying that one 'fails to reject the null hypothesis'.
    This is comparable to the way in which a court of law avoids declaring someone
    to be innocent in favor of declaring someone to be not guilty. Type II error is
    generally represented by the Greek letter 'beta'.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Another name for a type II error is ___________.
  AnswerChoices: false positive; false negative; alpha; true positive
  CorrectAnswer: false negative
  AnswerTests: word= false negative
  Hint: Review the previous paragraph.

- Class: text
  Output: 'The concept of power is closely related to that of a type II error. Power
    is the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis
    is false. Since the type II error rate is the probability of INCORRECTLY failing to
    reject the null hypothesis and power is the probability of CORRECTLY rejecting the null
    hypothesis, power is therefore equal to one minus the type II error rate (or in
    mathematical terms, power = 1 - beta). '

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Another name for power is ___________.
  AnswerChoices: true positive; beta; true negative; false negative
  CorrectAnswer: true positive
  AnswerTests: word= true positive
  Hint: Power is the probability of CORRECTLY detecting something (i.e. having a 'positive'
    test result).

- Class: text
  Output: You are part of a research team conducting an experiment on the effectiveness
    of a new test that is designed to detect the presence of a deadly disease. Existing
    methods of detecting this disease are extremely reliable, but also very expensive.
    The appeal of this new test is that it is significantly cheaper than the existing
    method, although it may not be quite as reliable.

- Class: text
  Output: 'To estabilish the validity of your new test, your team performs both the
    new test and the existing test on a large group of consenting individuals. It
    is assumed that the diagnosis given by the existing test is the true diagnosis.
    The new test performs as follows: Among people who actually have the disease (as
    diagnosed by the existing test) the new test correctly diagnoses 80% as having
    the disease and fails to correctly diagnose the remaining 20%. Among people who
    do not have the disease, the new test incorrectly diagnoses 4% as having the disease
    and correctly diagnoses the remaining 96% as not having the disease. Keep in mind
    that when performing a diagnostic test, the null hypothesis is always that the
    patient does not have the disease of interest.'

- Class: mult_question
  Output: What is the type I error of this test?
  AnswerChoices: 80%; 20%; 4%; 96%
  CorrectAnswer: 4%
  AnswerTests: word= 4%
  Hint: Type I error is the probability of incorrectly diagnosing someone as having
    the disease when she is in fact healthy.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: What is the type II error of this test?
  AnswerChoices: 80%; 20%; 4%; 96%
  CorrectAnswer: 20%
  AnswerTests: word= 20%
  Hint: Type II error is the probability of incorrectly diagnosing someone as healthy
    when he does in fact have the disease.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: What is the power of this test?
  AnswerChoices: 80%; 20%; 4%; 96%
  CorrectAnswer: 80%
  AnswerTests: word= 80%
  Hint: Power is the probability of correctly diagnosing someone as having the disease
    when she does in fact have the disease.

- Class: text
  Output: For the remainder of the lesson, we will shift our focus to power and its
    important role in sample size calculations for experiments.

- Class: text
  Output: In the lecture, you learned how to compute power given a large sample size
    and a known population standard deviation (or sigma). This is an important calculation
    to understand, but we will not review it here.

- Class: text
  Output: Instead, our focus will be on reversing this calculation to compute the
    sample size required to achieve a desired level of power (again, given a known
    sigma.) This calculation is most commonly used when designing experiments in order
    to ensure sample size is large enough to guarantee a powerful result.

- Class: text
  Output: 'Note that assuming a known sigma allows us to use the standard normal distribution
    in place of the t-distribution. We make this simplifying assumption here for the
    sake of conveying the concept at hand. Later in the lesson, we will review the
    more complicated process of computing sample size when sigma is unknown. '

- Class: text
  Output: 'Here are the values we need for our first sample size calculation: population
    standard deviation (sigma), the difference in means we''d like to be able to detect
    (delta), the z-critical value for our chosen significance level, and the z-critical
    value corresponding to our desired level of power.'

- Class: text
  Output: Let's work through an example. Pretend a road by your house has a posted
    speed limit of 65 miles per hour. You are interested in knowing if the true average
    speed at which cars travel on this road during rush hour is greater than or equal
    to 5 miles per hour ABOVE the speed limit (delta). To determine this, you will
    measure the speed at which a random selection of cars passes you on the road during
    rush hour. Assume a significance level of 0.05 (alpha) and that the population
    standard deviation in speed among all cars at this time is 10 miles per hour (sigma).
    Let's determine how many cars you will need to record so that you have an 80%
    chance of detecting a true difference of 5 or more miles per hour (power).

- Class: mult_question
  Output: For this experiment, are we interested in a one-sided or two-sided test?
  AnswerChoices: One-sided; Two-sided; Neither, that's a trick question!
  CorrectAnswer: One-sided
  AnswerTests: word= One-sided
  Hint: In this example, are you interested in knowing whether cars are travelling
    at speeds lower than the posted speed limit?

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now let's define the variables we'll use in our sample size calculation.
    Assign the appropriate value to a new variable called 'sigma'.
  CorrectAnswer: sigma <- 10
  AnswerTests: swirl1cmd=sigma <- 10
  Hint: Sigma represents the true population standard deviation of speeds.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Assign the appropriate value to a new variable called 'delta'.
  CorrectAnswer: delta <- 5
  AnswerTests: swirl1cmd=delta <- 5
  Hint: Delta represents the difference in true average speeds that you would like
    to be able to detect.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Since our significance level is 0.05, we need to find the z-critical value
    for which 5% of the standard normal distribution lies above it. In other words,
    95% of the standard normal distribution falls below this point. This '95th percentile'
    is also called a '0.95 quantile', and is thus found with the 'qnorm' function
    in R ('q' for 'quantile' and 'norm' for 'normal'). Use this function now on the
    value 0.95 and assign the result to a new variable called 'zAlpha'.
  CorrectAnswer: zAlpha <- qnorm(0.95)
  AnswerTests: swirl1cmd=zAlpha <- qnorm(0.95)
  Hint: Type 'qnorm(0.95)' to find the value of the 0.95 quantile.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Since our desired power level is 80%, that means that we want to design
    our study in such a way that we have an 80% chance of correctly rejecting our
    null hypothesis. Thus our corresponding z-critical value should have 80% of the
    standard normal distribution lying above it and hence 20% below it. Use the 'qnorm'
    function again to find the 20th percentile and assign the result to a new variable
    called 'zBeta'.
  CorrectAnswer: zBeta <- qnorm(0.20)
  AnswerTests: swirl1cmd=zBeta <- qnorm(0.20)
  Hint: The 20th percentile is also known as the 0.20 quantile and can be found in
    the same way as you found the 0.95 quantile above.

- Class: text
  Output: We now have everything we need to compute our required sample size. Since
    it's a bit challenging to express the sample size formula in words, I'm going
    to give you the code for computing it below.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: 'To compute the sample size required to achieve 80% power in our example,
    type the following: ''(sigma / delta)^2 * (zAlpha - zBeta)^2''. Note that ''x^2''
    is R notation for ''x-squared'' or ''x to the power of 2''.'
  CorrectAnswer: (sigma / delta)^2 * (zAlpha - zBeta)^2
  AnswerTests: swirl1cmd=(sigma / delta)^2 * (zAlpha - zBeta)^2
  Hint: Type '(sigma / delta)^2 * (zAlpha - zBeta)^2' and press Enter.

- Class: text
  Output: Now that you've computed the required sample size manually, let's perform
    the same task using a function from the R package called 'pwr'. In case you're
    new to R packages, they are simply libraries of additional functions that people
    like you have created for everyone to use. Normally,  you would have to load a
    new package on your own using the 'library' function, but for simplicity we have
    already done this for you here.

- Class: text
  Output: 'The function we will use is called ''pwr.norm.test'' and it will automatically
    generate the sample size required for 80% power once we specify the necessary
    information. Here are the items we need to give it: effect size (which is the
    difference we wish to detect divided by sigma), significance level, power, and
    whether we are conducting a one- or two-sided test.'

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: First, compute the effect size using the variables 'delta' and 'sigma',
    both of which you've already computed. Save the result in a new variable called
    'effectSize'.
  CorrectAnswer: effectSize <- delta / sigma
  AnswerTests: swirl1cmd=effectSize <- delta / sigma
  Hint: Divide 'delta' by 'sigma' and assign the result to a new variable called 'effectSize'.

- Class: text
  Output: We already know the significance and power levels that we want and we are
    interested in a one-sided test. In this case, our one-sided test applies only
    to the case when the true speed is GREATER or equal to 10 miles per hour above
    the posted speed limit. Therefore, we will specifiy the test type as "greater".

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: 'You now have everything you need to call the ''pwr.norm.test'' function.
    Here is the format: ''pwr.norm.test(d=effectSize, sig.level=0.05, power=0.80,
    alternative="greater")''. Enter this now.'
  CorrectAnswer: pwr.norm.test(d=effectSize, sig.level=0.05, power=0.80, alternative="greater")
  AnswerTests: swirl1cmd=pwr.norm.test(d=effectSize, sig.level=0.05, power=0.80, alternative="greater")
  Hint: Type 'pwr.norm.test(d=effectSize, sig.level=0.05, power=0.80, alternative="greater")'
    and press Enter.

- Class: text
  Output: This function provides several items of interest, but the only one we are
    concerned with here is the value of 'n', which is our sample size required to
    achieve a power of 80% in this scenario. You'll notice that it perfectly matches
    the result you got when doing the manual calculation.

- Class: text
  Output: Since the sample size is reported as a decimal number, it is good practice
    to round up to the nearest whole number since we generally can't study a fraction
    of a car (person, mouse, etc.)

- Class: text
  Output: Up until this point, we've assumed a known population standard deviation
    (sigma). Sometimes this is available if a subject has be studied extensively,
    but this may often not be the case. If you are required to compute sigma from
    the data, then using a t-test is more appropriate.

- Class: text
  Output: Doing this manually is considerably more involved for reasons we won't review
    here, so we'll instead use the t-test version of the function I just showed you
    above. The name of this function is 'pwr.t.test' and it is also found in the 'pwr'
    package.

- Class: text
  Output: The inputs to the 'pwr.t.test' function are identical to 'pwr.norm.test'
    with only one exception. You must specify whether we are doing a one-sample, two-sample,
    or paired t-test analysis. In this case we are doing a one-sample analysis so
    the 'type' parameter will equal "one.sample".

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: 'Perform the t-test version of your sample size calculation now using the
    following code: ''pwr.t.test(d=effectSize, sig.level=0.05, power=0.80, type="one.sample",
    alternative="greater")'''
  CorrectAnswer: pwr.t.test(d=effectSize, sig.level=0.05, power=0.80, type="one.sample",
    alternative="greater")
  AnswerTests: swirl1cmd=pwr.t.test(d=effectSize, sig.level=0.05, power=0.80, type="one.sample",
    alternative="greater")
  Hint: Type 'pwr.t.test(d=effectSize, sig.level=0.05, power=0.80, type="one.sample",
    alternative="greater")' and press Enter.

- Class: text
  Output: 'You''ll notice that the required sample size using the t-test is larger
    than the required sample size using the normal distribution. Since we are estimating
    the standard deviation instead of assuming a known quantity, we are introducing
    more uncertainty into the process. Hence, a t-test provides a more conservative
    estimate of the required sample size. '

- Class: text
  Output: You've completed this lesson! You learned about type I and type II errors,
    power, and sample size calculations. Great work!
