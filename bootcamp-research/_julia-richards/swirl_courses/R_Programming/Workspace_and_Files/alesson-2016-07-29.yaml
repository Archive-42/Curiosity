  Output: R can interact with files and folders on your 
    computer. R constantly keeps track of a working 
    directory which is a folder in which many R functions 
    automatically read and write files. Folders and 
    directories are synonymous terms.

  Output: You may have never thought about this before, but 
    files and folders on your computer are structured like 
    a tree. The root of the tree is your hard drive. All 
    files and folders are contained within your hard drive,
    and the series of folders you might have to navigate to
    get to a particular file are like the branches of a 
    tree. This is sequence of directories is often called a
    path.
