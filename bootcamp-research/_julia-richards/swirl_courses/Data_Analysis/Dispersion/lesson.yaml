  Output: 'Welcome to Lesson 2! In this lesson, we will learn what DISPERSION is and
    what statistical values are needed in order to best describe the spread of data.
    Further, you will learn all about a box-and-whisker plot which is  a plot commonly
    used by statisticians when determining variability. '

- Class: text
  Output: 'While measures of central tendency are used to estimate the middle values
    of a dataset, measures of dispersion are important for describing the spread of
    the data. '

- Class: text
  Output: The term dispersion refers to degree to which the data values are scattered
    around an average value. Dispersion is synonymous with other words such as variability
    and spread.

- Class: text
  Output: 'Why is it important to analyze the spread of a particular set of data?
    Two different samples may have the same mean or median, but different levels of
    variability or vice versa. '

- Class: mult_question
  Output: 'Therefore, it is important to describe both the __________ and _________
    of a data set. '
  AnswerChoices: median, variability; central tendency, dispersion; middle, mean;
    spread, variability
  CorrectAnswer: central tendency, dispersion
  AnswerTests: word= central tendency, dispersion
  Hint: The first term refers to the middle of a dataset. The second term refers to
    the spread of a dataset.

- Class: text
  Output: 'In this lesson, we will discuss the three statistical values most commonly
    used to describe the dispersion or variability of a data set. Variability is a
    fancy term used to classify how variable or spread out the data is. '

- Class: text
  Output: 'The first descriptive statistic that can describe the variability of a
    data set is known as the RANGE. The range is the difference between the maximum
    and minimum values of the data set. '

- Class: text
  Output: 'To demonstrate how you can use R to determine the range of a data set we
    will refer back to the cars data set from the previous lesson. '

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: 'Type in the R-command ''range(cars$price)'' to determine the exact values
    for the minimum and maximum prices of cars in the data set. '
  CorrectAnswer: range(cars$price)
  AnswerTests: swirl1cmd=range(cars$price)
  Hint: 'Type in ''range(cars$price)'' without quotations and press enter to see the
    minimum and maximum prices. '

- Class: exact_question
  Output: 'Now that you have the minimum and maximum ''price'' values, calculate the
    range of the ''price'' data. '
  CorrectAnswer: '54.5'
  AnswerTests: exact=54.5
  Hint: Subtract the minimum price value from the maximum price value.

- Class: text
  Output: The second important measure of variability is known as VARIANCE. Mathematically,
    VARIANCE is the average of the squared differences from the mean. More simply,
    variance represents the total distance of the data from the mean.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: 'In R, you can use the command ''var(data)'' to easily calculate the variance
    of a particular set of data. Try calculating the variance for the data ''cars$price''. '
  CorrectAnswer: var(cars$price)
  AnswerTests: swirl1cmd=var(cars$price)
  Hint: Type in 'var(cars$price)' without quotations and press enter to see the variance
    of the prices of cars.

- Class: text
  Output: 'The values for variance and standard deviation are very closely related.
    The standard deviation can be calculated by taking the square root of the variance
    where as the variance can be calculated by squaring the standard deviation. '

- Class: text
  Output: To statisticians, the standard deviation is a more conventional measure
    of variability because it is expressed in the same units as the original data
    values.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Similar to variance, you can use the R-command 'sd(data)' to calculate the
    standard deviation of a particular set of data. Try calculating the standard deviation
    for the data 'cars$price'.
  CorrectAnswer: sd(cars$price)
  AnswerTests: swirl1cmd=sd(cars$price)
  Hint: Type in 'sd(cars$price)' without quotations and press enter to see the standard
    deviation of the prices of cars.

- Class: text
  Output: The standard deviation is very important when analyzing our data set. A
    small standard deviation indicates that the data points tend to be located near
    the mean value, while a large standard deviation indicates that the data points
    are spread further from the mean.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: 'Three important measures of variability are which of the following: '
  AnswerChoices: mean, median, range; spread, mean, central tendency; variance, dispersion,
    spread; range, variance, standard deviation
  CorrectAnswer: range, variance, standard deviation
  AnswerTests: word= range, variance, standard deviation
  Hint: 'Look for the three specific terms that we focused on calculating. '

- Class: text
  Output: A BOX PLOT, also called a BOX-AND-WHISKER PLOT, is used to summarize the
    main descriptive statistics of a particular data set and this type of plot helps
    illustrate the concept of variability. A box plot is used to visually represent
    the MINIMUM, FIRST QUARTILE (Q1), MEDIAN, THIRD QUARTILE (Q3), and MAXIMUM of
    a data set.

- Class: video
  Output: Would you like to watch a brief YouTube video on box-and-whisker plots?

- Class: figure
  Output: 'Here I have created a box plot to represent the price data for each of
    the three car types: large, midsize, and small. You''ll notice that each of the
    3 figures is composed of a closed 4-sided "box" with "whiskers" on the top and
    bottom, hence the name box-and-whisker plot.'
  Figure: mod1_boxplot.R
  FigureType: new

- Class: text
  Output: The height of each box is referred to as the INTERQUARTILE RANGE (IQR).
    The more variability within the data, the larger the IQR. On the other hand, less
    variability within the data means a smaller IQR. The bottom of the box in the
    box plot corresponds to the value of the first quartile (Q1), and the top of the
    box corresponds to the value of the third quartile (Q3). To calculate the value
    of the IQR, simply subtract the value of Q1 from that of Q3.

- Class: text
  Output: The whiskers, or lines, that extend above and below each box represent roughly
    the upper 25% and lower 25% of data points, respectively. The only exception is
    when there are outliers, which I'll explain shortly.

- Class: range_question
  Output: Looking at the box plot, what is the approximate interquartile range for
    the midsize vehicles?
  CorrectAnswer: 16; 22
  AnswerTests: range=16-22
  Hint: Subtract the Q1 value from the Q3 value. The Q1 value is the minimum value
    contained in the box and the Q3 value is the maximum value contained in the box.

- Class: text
  Output: Let's take a closer look at how quartiles are calculated. We start by sorting
    the data from least to greatest, just like when calculating the median. The first
    quartile (Q1), also known as the 25th PERCENTILE (since 25% of the data points
    fall at or below this value), is simply the median of the first half of the sorted
    data. Likewise, the third quartile (Q3), also known as the 75th percentile, is
    the median of the second half of the sorted data.

- Class: figure
  Output: As shown in this plot, the blue horizontal line illustrates how to find
    the value for the first quartile. The green horizontal line illustrates how to
    find the value for the third quartile. The interquartile range is the range of
    data values that is contained in between these two lines.
  Figure: mod1_boxplot_add.R
  FigureType: addition

- Class: figure
  Output: 'Look again at our box plot of price vs. car type. You may be thinking to
    yourself, ''What is that circle above the box plots for the midsize cars, and
    why is there no circle above the box plot for the large cars?'' Those circles
    represent OUTLIERS in the data set. '
  Figure: mod1_boxplot.R
  FigureType: new

- Class: figure
  Output: An OUTLIER is an observation that is unusual or extreme relative to the
    other values in the data set. Outliers are useful in identifying a heavy skew
    in a distribution, and may signify a data collection or data entry error to a
    scientist. There are many different conventions for identifying outliers within
    a data set.
  Figure: mod1_boxplot.R
  FigureType: new

- Class: mult_question
  Output: When looking at the box plot, which car types appear to have outliers?
  AnswerChoices: small, midsize; midsize, large; small, large; small, midsize, large
  CorrectAnswer: small, midsize
  AnswerTests: word=small, midsize
  Hint: Look for the types of cars that correspond to the box plots with circles above
    or below them.

- Class: figure
  Output: As you can see in the box plot, the data for prices of 'midsize' cars vary
    from around 15 to 62, encompassing a range of approximately 50. This is a great
    deal larger than the variation for 'small' cars which range from around 5 to 15,
    encompassing a range of approximately 10. Therefore, since the range is much greater
    for 'midsize' cars, prices of 'midsize' cars have much higher variability in comparison
    to the prices of 'small' cars.
  Figure: mod1_boxplot.R
  FigureType: new

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Now it is your turn! Is the variability of prices of cars of type 'large'
    higher or lower than that of cars of type 'small'?
  AnswerChoices: higher; lower; the same
  CorrectAnswer: higher
  AnswerTests: word=higher
  Hint: Look to see if the range of cars of type 'large' is greater or less than that
    of cars of type 'small'.

- Class: text
  Output: 'You have officially mastered the concept of dispersion and have fully learned
    how to read and interpret a box-and-whisker plot. These are two very valuable
    tools used everyday in descriptive statistics. Congratulations! In the next lesson,
    you will learn about data visualization. '
