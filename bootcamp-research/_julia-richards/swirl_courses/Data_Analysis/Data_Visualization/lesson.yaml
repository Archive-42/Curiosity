- Class: text
  Output: Now that you have learned the basics techniques and statistical calculations
    used to describe a data set, the next step is figuring out how to effectively
    illustrate and visualize your data.

- Class: text
  Output: It is useful to first visualize the data before a statistician engages in
    a thorough analysis of the data set. In this lesson, we are going to learn useful
    techniques for visualizing numerical variables.

- Class: text
  Output: 'By organizing the data into a PLOT or GRAPH, a statistician is able to
    explore and summarize some basic properties of the data set. The discipline of
    quantitatively describing the main properties of a data set is known as DESCRIPTIVE
    STATISTICS. '

- Class: text
  Output: The simplest type of plot is the DOT PLOT, which is used to visually convey
    the values of one variable. In a dot plot, there is only a horizontal x-axis,
    and the data points are represented as dots above this axis.

- Class: figure
  Output: Here is a dot plot created using the variable 'price' from our 'cars' data set. As you may notice, the price is reported along the x-axis in $1000s, and each point above the axis represents the price of one of the
    54 cars in our data set.
  Figure: mod1_dotplot.R
  FigureType: new

- Class: range_question
  Output: When looking at this dot plot, around what price (in $1000s) does there
    appear to be the highest density of data points?
  CorrectAnswer: 7; 13
  AnswerTests: range=7-13
  Hint: Look at the part of the graph where the dots are the darkest and closest together.

- Class: text
  Output: Since dot plots effectively display the specific numerical value of one
    variable for each individual in the data set, they are particularly useful when
    analyzing smaller data sets.

- Class: text
  Output: A HISTOGRAM is similar to a dot plot, but instead of showing every specific
    value, it partitions the values of your data into several bins, providing a more
    condensed representation of the data.

- Class: figure
  Output: Here I have created a histogram using the miles per gallon data for all
    of our cars. As you may notice, the values of the MPG along the x-axis are partitioned
    into bins with a range of 5. The second bin, for example, groups together all
    of the cars that get 21-25 MPG in the city, and so forth. Note that the bin to
    the left of this contains those cars with 20 MPG since this value cannot be counted
    in both bins. The frequency of values in each bin, or the number of cars in each
    of the intervals, is reported along the y-axis.
  Figure: mod1_histogram.R
  FigureType: new

- Class: text
  Output: Taller bars signify the range of values in which the majority of the data
    is located, whereas shorter bars represent a range of values in which only a little
    bit of the data is located. In other words, histograms provide a view of the DATA
    DENSITY.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: By simply looking at this histogram, can you tell me which MPG interval
    has the highest frequency of values? For example, the lowest frequencies of values
    occur in the intervals 36-40, 41-45, and 46-50.
  AnswerChoices: 16-20; 21-25; 26-30; 31-35; 36-40; 41-45; 46-50
  CorrectAnswer: 16-20
  AnswerTests: word= 16-20
  Hint: 'Look for the bin values corresponding to the tallest bar in the histogram. '

- Class: exact_question
  Output: How many cars get 16-20 MPG in the city?
  CorrectAnswer: '25'
  AnswerTests: exact=25
  Hint: Look at the highest value on the y-axis that the '16-20' bar reaches.

- Class: figure
  Output: A red line has been drawn on our histogram illustrating the previous answer.

- Class: text
  Output: 'Histograms are particularly useful in viewing and describing the shape
    of the distribution of the data. A distribution of data may have a left skew,
    a right skew, or no skew at all. SKEWNESS is a measure of the extent to which
    the distribution of the data ''leans'' to one side or the other. '

- Class: figure
  Output: 'A distribution that has a left skew is one in which the left TAIL of the
    plot is longer. In other words, on a histogram the majority of the distribution
    is located to the right of the mean. '
  Figure: mod1_leftskew.R
  FigureType: new

- Class: text
  Output: When a distribution is left-skewed, the value of the MEAN is less than that
    of the MEDIAN, and thus the MEAN is located further to the left of the distribution.
    In this plot, the green line represents the median and the blue line represents
    the mean.

- Class: figure
  Output: On the other hand, a distribution that has a right skew is one in which
    the right tail is longer, such that the majority of the data falls to the left
    of the mean, when viewed on the histogram.
  Figure: mod1_rightskew.R
  FigureType: new

- Class: text
  Output: When a distribution is right-skewed, the value of the MEAN is greater than
    that of the MEDIAN, and thus the MEAN is located further to the right of the distribution.
    In this plot, the green line represents the median and the blue line represents
    the mean.

- Class: figure
  Output: 'A plot that has no skew is one in which the tails on both sides of the
    mean balance out, and is referred to as symmetric. When a distribution is symmetric,
    the MEAN and MEDIAN are approximately equal in value. '
  Figure: mod1_symmetric.R
  FigureType: new

- Class: text
  Output: In this plot, the green line represents the median and the blue line represents
    the mean. The green line is the only one visible since the mean and median are
    close to the same value.

- Class: figure
  Output: 'Now, let''s take a look back at the histogram we made earlier, which represents
    the distribution of the values for city MPG for each of the 54 cars from our ''cars''
    data set. '
  Figure: mod1_histogram.R
  FigureType: new

- Class: mult_question
  Output: How would you classify the shape of the distribution represented by this
    histogram?
  AnswerChoices: Symmetric; Right-skewed; Left-skewed
  CorrectAnswer: Right-skewed
  AnswerTests: word= Right-skewed
  Hint: Look to see which end of the tail extends longer. The data will be skewed
    in that direction. Or, look to see whether the tails extend to relatively the
    same length on each side.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Referring to the histogram above, and keeping in mind the real shape of
    the distribution, would you expect the MEDIAN to be greater than, less than, or
    equal to the MEAN?
  AnswerChoices: Greater than; Less than; Equal to
  CorrectAnswer: Less than
  AnswerTests: word= Less than
  Hint: Reread above to figure out what the value of the median is in comparison to
    the mean when a distribution is right-skewed.

- Class: text
  Output: 'A special type of histogram is known as a STEM-AND-LEAF PLOT. This plot
    organizes numerical data in order of decimal place value. The left-hand column
    of the plot contains the STEMS, or the numerical values of the tens digit for
    each of the data points, organized vertically in increasing order. The LEAVES
    are located in the right-hand column of the plot and are the values of the ones
    digit for each data point of the corresponding stem, organized horizontally in
    increasing order. '

- Class: text
  Output: In a stem-and-leaf plot, the number of leaves is equal to the number of
    items in the data set. The easiest way to understand a stem-and-leaf plot is to
    see one!

- Class: video
  Output: Would you like to watch a brief YouTube video on stem-and-leaf plots?
  VideoLink: http://youtu.be/OaJXJduRiIE

- Class: figure
  Output: I have created a stem-and-leaf plot above using the same values for the
    'mpgCity' variable as we just used for our histogram. As you can see, a stem-and-leaf
    plot is a useful type of histogram if you want to see the frequencies of specific
    values of the data. Often, there will only be one bin per tens digit, but in this
    case, R gives us the same bins as we saw in our histogram.
  Figure: mod1_stem.R
  FigureType: new

- Class: exact_question
  Output: Demonstrated on this stem-and-leaf plot, how many occurences of the value
    '22' are there in this particular data set?
  CorrectAnswer: '4'
  AnswerTests: exact=4

- Class: figure
  Output: The final plot that can be used for discrete or continuous variables is
    known as the BOX PLOT, also called a BOX-AND-WHISKER PLOT. As you previously learned,
    this plot is used to summarize the main descriptive statistics of a particular
    data set and help illustrates the concept of variability. I have created a box-and-whisker
    plot so that you can be reminded of what it looks like.
  Figure: mod1_boxplot.R
  FigureType: new

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: A box plot is used to visually represent the MINIMUM, FIRST QUARTILE (Q1),
    MEDIAN, THIRD QUARTILE (Q3), and MAXIMUM of a data set. The R-command 'summary(cars$price)'
    returns values for these main descriptive statistics. Try this now.
  CorrectAnswer: summary(cars$price)
  AnswerTests: swirl1cmd=summary(cars$price)

- Class: text
  Output: 'Up until now, every plot I have introduced has involved only one continous or discrete variable. In a future lesson, we will learn about the plots that are used for categorical variables and multiple variables.'
