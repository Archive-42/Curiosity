  Output: In this lesson, we'll briefly introduce basics of statistical inference, the process of drawing conclusions "about a population using noisy statistical data where uncertainty must be accounted for". In other words, statistical inference lets scientists formulate conclusions from data and quantify the uncertainty arising from using incomplete data.

- Class: mult_question  
  Output: Which of the following is NOT an example of statistical inference? 
  AnswerChoices: Polling before an election to predict its outcome; Constructing a medical image from fMRI data; Testing the efficacy of a new drug; Recording the results of a statistics exam
  CorrectAnswer: Recording the results of a statistics exam
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='Recording the results of a statistics exam')
  Hint: Which of the choices involves concrete data that doesn't require any inference or generalization?

- Class: text
  Output: So statistical inference involves formulating conclusions using data AND quantifying the uncertainty associated with those conclusions. The uncertainty could arise from incomplete or bad data.

- Class: mult_question  
  Output: Which of the following would NOT be a source of bad data? 
  AnswerChoices: Small sample size; Selection bias; A randomly selected sample of population; A poorly designed study 
  CorrectAnswer: A randomly selected sample of population
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='A randomly selected sample of population')
  Hint: Which of the choices would allow one to draw reasonable inferences?

- Class: mult_question
  Output: So with statistical inference we use data to draw general conclusions about a population. Which of the following would  a scientist using statistical inference techniques consider a problem?
  AnswerChoices: Our data sample is representative of the population; Our study has no bias and is well-designed; Contaminated data 
  CorrectAnswer: Contaminated data
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='Contaminated data')
  Hint: Which of the choices is obviously bad?

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Which of the following is NOT an example of statistical inference in action?
  AnswerChoices: Estimating the proportion of people who will vote for a candidate; Testing the effectiveness of a medical treatment; Determining a causative mechanism underlying a disease; Counting sheep
  CorrectAnswer: Counting sheep
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='Counting sheep')
  Hint: Which of the choices is exact?

- Class: text
  Output: We want to emphasize a couple of important points here. First, a statistic (singular) is a number computed from a sample of data. We use statistics to infer information about a population. Second, a random variable is an outcome from an experiment. Deterministic processes, such as computing means or variances, applied to random variables, produce additional random variables which have their own distributions. It's important to keep straight which distributions you're talking about. 

- Class: text
  Output: Finally, there are two broad flavors of inference. The first is frequency, which uses "long run proportion of times an event occurs in independent, identically distributed repetitions." The second is Bayesian in which the probability estimate for a hypothesis is updated as additional evidence is acquired. Both flavors require an understanding of probability so that's what the next lessons will cover.
