  Lesson: Overview of Statistics
  Author: Nick Carchedi
  Type: Standard
  Organization: JHU Biostatistics
  Version: 1.0.0

- Class: text
  Output: In a very broad sense of the term, a scientist is one who engages in a systematic
    method to acquire knowledge. More importantly, a scientist seeks to answer important
    questions or problems through careful observations and methods. These observations
    - collected from experiments, censuses, surveys, field notes, etc. - are known
    as DATA. Statistics is the study of how best to collect, analyze, and draw conclusions
    from data.

- Class: text
  Output: Once a question has been posed, or a problem identified, the next logical
    step is to attempt to answer the question. Unfortunately, without any additional
    information, it is very difficult to answer a question, or diagnose a problem.
    This is where data collection comes into play! Having a set of observations, or
    data, related to the question will help reveal an answer.

- Class: text
  Output: But how exactly does one collect useful data?

- Class: text
  Output: Remember, when conducting research, a scientist wants to answer a question,
    one that is usually targeted at a specific population. This population does not
    have to be a human population, as in the most common meaning of the word. Think
    of this population as the group of entities - people, animals, cars, salaries,
    etc. - that is to be studied by the scientist.

- Class: text
  Output: Unfortunately, it is often very difficult, if not impossible, to collect
    thorough data from an entire population. Not only can it be very time-consuming
    to do so, it may also  be an inefficient use of resources. Instead, scientists
    target a SAMPLE population. This sample population is selected in such a way that
    it is REPRESENTATIVE of the larger population in question. In mathematical terms,
    this sample population is called a subset of the target population.

- Class: figure
  Output: Here is a simple visual illustration of how a sample is related to a population.
  Figure: mod1_pop_vs_samp.R
  FigureType: new

- Class: mult_question
  Output: 'Let''s quickly test your understanding of the term ''representative.''
    If you were interested in studying the health of men living in the U.S., ages
    18-25, which sample would be more representative of the target population: a sample
    of 25 men who live in a nearby retirement home, or a sample of 25 men who are
    students at a local university?'
  AnswerChoices: Men living at the retirement home; College students
  CorrectAnswer: College students
  AnswerTests: word= College students
  Hint: Since your target population is technically all men ages 18-25 living in the
    U.S., which of these 2 sample populations more closely matches the population
    of interest?

- Class: text
  Output: Now that you have a basic idea of how a scientist collects data, the next
    step is to learn what to do with all of this data. While this raw data does contain
    useful information, this information is usually specific to each individual in
    the sample population. The scientist seeks to discover trends and correlations
    among the subjects in the sample population, so that he or she may draw conclusions
    about the target population as a whole.

- Class: text
  Output: To check your understanding of some of the concepts of data collection that
    we have covered thus far, see if you can complete the following sentence.

- Class: text_order_question
  Output: A statistician collects data from a __________ in order to generalize results
    to an entire __________. (Separate the two words in your response with a comma.)
  CorrectAnswer: sample, population
  AnswerTests: word_order=sample, population
  Hint: The first term is a subset of the second. Make sure you type two words separated
    by a comma.

- Class: text
  Output: To truly gather as much useful information from the data as possible, it
    is important to learn how to analyze a data set like a statistician!

- Class: text
  Output: 'Before we delve too deeply into the specifics of data visualization and
    simple data analysis, I would like to introduce a helpful resource. Throughout
    our lessons, I will use as a reference the free online textbook, ''OpenIntro Statistics,''
    written by David M. Diez, Christopher D. Barr, and Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel. If at
    any time you feel as if you would like a more thorough explanation of the concepts,
    you may access the textbook via the following URL: http://www.openintro.org/stat/down/OpenIntroStatSecond.pdf'

- Class: text
  Output: In addition to this textbook, you'll have the option to watch short videos
    on various topics as you progress through the lessons. Let's keep going!

- Class: text
  Output: Today, statistical analysis is inseparable from computing. As we collect
    greater amounts of data and face more complex statistical problems, we must use
    special software to help us more easily gain insight from this data.

- Class: text
  Output: There are many such software tools available to us, however, we will be
    focusing on one in particular called R. There are many good reasons to use R,
    but most importantly it is high quality, free of cost, and available to anyone
    who wishes to use it. I will be using R as a teaching tool for the topics we'll
    cover together and before you know it, you will know R well enough to perform
    data analysis on your own.

- Class: text
  Output: Learning R is like learning any other language. There are certain rules
    that you must follow in order to get the desired results. Let's review some of
    those basic rules here, so that you can start using R right away.

- Class: text
  Output: Let's say we wanted to store the value '5' in a new variable 'x'. The way
    we would do this in R is by typing 'x <- 5'. The ASSIGNMENT OPERATOR is the '<-'
    in between 'x' and '5,' which says 'x gets the value 5'. It is really just a 'less
    than' sign followed by a dash. Now it's your turn to try.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Store the value '100' in a new variable called 'y'.
  CorrectAnswer: y <- 100
  AnswerTests: swirl1cmd=y <- 100
  Hint: 'Use the same syntax that we just introduced. Example: ''x <- 5''. Notice
    there''s a space before and after the assignment operator.'

- Class: text
  Output: Besides storing a single number in a variable, you can also store text,
    vectors, matrices, and even whole data sets, which R users call DATA FRAMES. Once
    you've stored something in a variable, you can then use that variable by name
    when performing other operations.

- Class: text
  Output: Each column of a data frame contains the data for one variable. In order
    to access the values for one particular variable in R, we use the syntax 'data.set.name$variable.name'.
    A dollar sign is placed after the data set name and before the variable name with
    no spaces. For example, say we wanted to access the data for the variable 'fruits'
    from the data set 'foods'. In R, we would do this by typing 'foods$fruits'.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's see if you can do this on your own. Type in the command to access
    the data for the variable called 'type' from the data set called 'cars'. We'll
    be working with the 'cars' data set quite a bit later in the lesson, but for now
    don't worry too much about the output you'll see.
  CorrectAnswer: cars$type
  AnswerTests: swirl1cmd=cars$type
  Hint: Type your data set name and then a dollar sign, '$', and finally the variable
    name with no spaces in between.

- Class: text
  Output: R has many BUILT-IN FUNCTIONS that you can use to perform analysis. As we
    progress through our lessons, I will introduce many of these functions to you
    as they become relevant. To use a particular function, the syntax is usually something
    like 'FunctionName(variable)'. Some more advanced functions require more information
    from you in the form of ARGUMENTS, which are just additional inputs placed inside
    of the parentheses.

- Class: text
  Output: Let's try a very simple function on the variable 'y' that you just created
    above.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Since you stored the value 100 in the variable 'y', type 'sqrt(y)' to get
    the square root of 100.
  CorrectAnswer: sqrt(y)
  AnswerTests: swirl1cmd=sqrt(y)
  Hint: Type 'sqrt(y)' without quotes and press 'enter'.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now use the same function, but this time try storing 'sqrt(y)' in a new
    variable 'z' using the assignment operator that you just learned about.
  CorrectAnswer: z <- sqrt(y)
  AnswerTests: swirl1cmd=z <- sqrt(y)
  Hint: Assign 'sqrt(y)' to z.

- Class: text
  Output: If you ever find yourself unsure about how a particular function works,
    you can tap into R's help files for answers. The syntax for doing so is 'help(FunctionName)'
    or more simply just '?FunctionName' with no space between the '?' and the 'FunctionName'.
    If, instead, you are not sure of the function you are looking for, you can perform
    a general search through all of R's built-in functions using 'help.search(term_of_interest)'
    or again, more simply '??term_of_interest'.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: View the help file for the 'sqrt' function now. Use the shorthand version
    I just showed you. Notice the help file that pops up. Feel free to spend a few
    minutes checking it out. You'll get more comfortable with R help files as you
    gain more experience using them.
  CorrectAnswer: ?sqrt
  AnswerTests: swirl1cmd=?sqrt
  Hint: Do not include parentheses or variable names when accessing help files. Just
    type '?FunctionName'.

- Class: text
  Output: In addition to R's built-in functions, R also contains many built-in data
    sets that you may easily access and use. I will use one unique data set per lesson
    to help convey the important concepts at hand.

- Class: text
  Output: 'In this lesson, I will use the same ''cars'' data set as the ''OpenIntro
    Statistics'' textbook uses in its first chapter. This data set consists of 54
    rows and 6 columns. For each of 54 cars from 1993, the following variables are
    reported: type (large, midsize, small), price (USD), city miles per gallon (MPG),
    drive train (4WD, front, rear), passengers, and weight (lbs.).'

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Type 'cars' now to view the entire data set. You'll see that each row represents
    one car and each column holds one of the variables we just discussed above. You
    already saw the contents of the 'type' variable when you entered 'cars$type'.
  CorrectAnswer: cars
  AnswerTests: swirl1cmd=cars
  Hint: Just type 'cars' and press Enter.

- Class: text
  Output: I chose this data set for a few reasons. To effectively convey the key concepts
    of this section, I wanted a data set that was neither too large nor too small,
    and one that had at least two CONTINUOUS VARIABLES and one DISCRETE or CATEGORICAL
    VARIABLE.

- Class: text
  Output: A CONTINUOUS VARIABLE is one that can assume any value within the scope
    of the problem. For the 'cars' data set, price, city MPG, and weight are all continuous
    variables, as there is no inherent restriction on the possible values of each
    of the three variables (except for negative numbers, of course!)

- Class: text
  Output: On the other hand, a DISCRETE VARIABLE is a variable that may take on one
    of a limited, and usually fixed, number of possible values. A CATEGORICAL VARIABLE
    is similar to a discrete variable, however, instead of assuming a fixed value,
    the variable is ascribed a fixed categorical description. In our 'cars' data set,
    the number of passengers is a discrete variable, while the type and drive train
    are examples of categorical variables. Notice that the number of passengers is
    a discrete variable since the capacity of each car may only be described in whole
    numbers.

- Class: text
  Output: Let's test your knowledge on these different types of variables. Pretend
    you are going on a walk through town.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: The distance you walk would be an example of what type of variable?
  AnswerChoices: Continuous; Discrete; Categorical
  CorrectAnswer: Continuous
  AnswerTests: word= Continuous
  Hint: This variable is one that can assume any value within the scope of the problem.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: The types of buildings you pass along the way would be an example of what
    type of variable?
  AnswerChoices: Continuous; Discrete; Categorical
  CorrectAnswer: Categorical
  AnswerTests: word= Categorical
  Hint: This variable is one that is ascribed a fixed categorical description.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: The number of people you pass would be an example of what type of variable?
  AnswerChoices: Continuous; Discrete; Categorical
  CorrectAnswer: Discrete
  AnswerTests: word= Discrete
  Hint: This variable is one that may take on one of a limited, and usually fixed,
    number of possible values.

- Class: text
  Output: You are now ready to learn about data visualization!

- Class: text
  Output: Before a statistician engages in a thorough analysis of the data set, it
    is useful to first visualize the data. By organizing the data into a PLOT or GRAPH,
    a statistician is able to explore and summarize some basic properties of the data
    set. The discipline of quantitatively describing the main properties of a data
    set is known as DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS. In the subsequent sections, I will concurrently
    introduce techniques for data visualization as well as the related descriptive
    statistical measures.

- Class: text
  Output: The simplest type of plot is the DOT PLOT, which is used to visually convey
    the values of one variable. In a dot plot, there is only a horizontal x-axis,
    and the data points are represented as dots above this axis. Since dot plots effectively
    display the specific numerical value of one variable for each individual in the
    data set, it is a particularly useful tool for smaller data sets.

- Class: figure
  Output: Here's a dot plot using the variable 'price' from our 'cars' data set. As
    you may notice, the price is reported along the x-axis in $1000s, and each point
    above the axis represents the price of one of the 54 cars in our data set.
  Figure: mod1_dotplot.R
  FigureType: new

- Class: range_question
  Output: When looking at this dot plot, around what price (in $1000s) does there
    appear to be the highest density of data points?
  CorrectAnswer: 13-Jul
  AnswerTests: range=7-13
  Hint: Look at the part of the graph where the dots are the darkest and closest together.

- Class: text
  Output: This discussion of the dot plot brings me to our first descriptive statistic,
    the RANGE of a data set. Just as the name would seem to imply, the range is the
    difference between the maximum and minimum values of the data set.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now that you know what the range measures, take a look back at our dot plot.
    Using the R-command 'range(cars$price)', determine the exact values for the minimum
    and maximum of the data set, respectively.
  CorrectAnswer: range(cars$price)
  AnswerTests: swirl1cmd=range(cars$price)
  Hint: Type in 'range(cars$price)' and hit enter to see the minimum and maximum prices.

- Class: figure
  Output: The first number given is the minimum and the second number given is the
    maximum. To represent these numbers visually, I've drawn 2 lines on the dot plot.
    As you can see, the red vertical line on the far left illustrates where the minimum
    value lies. The red vertical line on the far right illustrates where the maximum
    value lies. The range of the data is defined as the distance between these two
    red lines.
  Figure: mod1_dotplot_add.R
  FigureType: addition

- Class: text
  Output: One of the most common descriptive statistics is a MEASURE OF CENTRAL TENDENCY.
    For a specific data set, CENTRAL TENDENCY seeks to locate a central value or a
    typical value for a certain variable. It may also be referred to as the AVERAGE
    or the CENTER of the data. The most common measures of central tendency are the
    MEAN, MEDIAN, and MODE of a set of data. In the next few sections, I will continue
    to introduce different types of plots and show you how to calculate and visualize
    these measures of central tendency.

- Class: video
  Output: Would you like to watch a brief YouTube video on mean, median, and mode?
  VideoLink: http://youtu.be/h8EYEJ32oQ8

- Class: text
  Output: The ARITHMETIC MEAN, or simply just the MEAN or AVERAGE, is the most common
    measurement of the center of the data. To calculate the mean, you must first sum
    all of the values of interest, and then divide that sum by the total number of
    values used in the sum.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Using the R-command 'sum(cars$price)', can you tell me the sum of the prices
    of the 54 cars in the data set?
  CorrectAnswer: sum(cars$price)
  AnswerTests: swirl1cmd=sum(cars$price)
  Hint: Type in 'sum(cars$price)'.

- Class: exact_question
  Output: Now divide this number, using the '/' symbol as the division operator, by
    the total number of values in the data subset. What is this value?
  CorrectAnswer: '19.99259'
  AnswerTests: exact=19.99259
  Hint: Divide 1,079.6 by 54.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now you understand the process for calculating the mean. Fortunately for
    you, R contains a built-in function to automatically complete this process for
    you. Try typing the R-command 'mean(cars$price)'.
  CorrectAnswer: mean(cars$price)
  AnswerTests: swirl1cmd=mean(cars$price)
  Hint: Just type mean(cars$price) and hit enter.

- Class: text
  Output: Notice that this value, 19.99259, is exactly the same as what you got above
    when computing the mean on your own without using the mean() function!

- Class: text
  Output: Our second measure of central tendency is known as the MEDIAN. Just as the
    name would imply, the median is the 'middle value' of the data set.

- Class: text
  Output: To illustrate how to find the median, we will turn our attention to the
    miles per gallon ('mpgCity') data, since these data are nice round numbers.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: I have stored the values of the 'mpgCity' variable for ONLY midsize vehicles
    in a new variable called 'mpg.midsize', which you can view by typing 'mpg.midsize'
    below. Try it now.
  CorrectAnswer: mpg.midsize
  AnswerTests: swirl1cmd=mpg.midsize

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: In R, you may organize your data values from least to greatest using the
    'sort' function. Try using the command 'sort(mpg.midsize)' to sort the values
    stored in 'mpg.midsize'.
  CorrectAnswer: sort(mpg.midsize)
  AnswerTests: swirl1cmd=sort(mpg.midsize)

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Try assigning 'sort(mpg.midsize)' to a new variable called 'mpg.sorted'
    by using the assignment operator we introduced earlier.
  CorrectAnswer: mpg.sorted <- sort(mpg.midsize)
  AnswerTests: swirl1cmd=mpg.sorted <- sort(mpg.midsize)
  Hint: Type 'mpg.sorted <- sort(mpg.midsize)'

- Class: text
  Output: When the total number of values is odd, finding the median, or 'middle'
    value, is quite easy. However, if the total number of values is even, there is
    no middle value amongst the actual data. In this case, you must calculate the
    average of the two middle values amongst the data points. In other words, in the
    case of an even number of values, the MEDIAN is reported as the MEAN of the two
    middle values of the data set.

- Class: exact_question
  Output: Just by looking at the sorted data you generated above, what do you think
    the median is?
  CorrectAnswer: '19'
  AnswerTests: exact=19
  Hint: Remember that since we have an even number of values here, the MEDIAN is just
    the MEAN of the two middle values.

- Class: text
  Output: Even though we have an even number of data points, and thus two middle values,
    both middle values are 19, so their average is also 19.

- Class: text
  Output: Now that you understand what goes on behind the scenes to compute the median
    of a data set, I'll show you a quicker way to get the same answer using the R
    command 'median'. And the nice thing about doing it this way is that we don't
    need to sort the data beforehand.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Try computing the median of our original unsorted 'mpg.midsize' by using
    R's built-in 'median' function.
  CorrectAnswer: median(mpg.midsize)
  AnswerTests: swirl1cmd=median(mpg.midsize)
  Hint: If we wanted the median of 'x', we would type 'median(x)'.

- Class: text
  Output: Now you have learned about the RANGE, MEAN, and MEDIAN of a data set, and
    how to calculate the value of each using simple R-commands.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Another helpful command in R is the 'summary' command. As you will see,
    this command reports the values for the minimum, median, mean, and maximum of
    a particular data set. For now, just ignore the values labeled '1st Qu.' and '3rd
    Qu.', as we will get to those shortly! Try typing 'summary(cars$mpgCity)' to see
    exactly what it does.
  CorrectAnswer: summary(cars$mpgCity)
  AnswerTests: swirl1cmd=summary(cars$mpgCity)
  Hint: If we wanted the summary of 'x', we would type 'summary(x)'.

- Class: text
  Output: Let us continue with other types of plots!

- Class: text
  Output: A HISTOGRAM is similar to a dot plot, but instead of showing every specific
    value, it partitions the values of your data into several bins, providing a more
    condensed representation of the data. Taller bars signify the range of values
    in which the majority of the data is located, whereas shorter bars represent a
    range of values in which fewer data points are located. In other words, histograms
    provide a view of the DATA DENSITY.

- Class: video
  Output: Would you like to watch a brief YouTube video on histograms?
  VideoLink: http://youtu.be/4eLJGG2Ad30

- Class: figure
  Output: Here I have created a histogram using the miles per gallon data for ALL
    of our cars, not just the midsize ones that we worked with above. As you may notice,
    the values of the MPG along the x-axis are partitioned into bins with a range
    of 5. The second bin, for example, groups together all of the cars that get 21-25
    MPG in the city, and so forth. Note that the bin to the left of this contains
    the cars with 20 MPG since this value cannot be counted in both bins. The frequency
    of values in each bin, or the number of cars in each of the intervals, is reported
    along the y-axis.
  Figure: mod1_histogram.R
  FigureType: new

- Class: mult_question
  Output: By simply looking at this histogram, can you tell me which MPG interval
    has the highest frequency of values? For example, the lowest frequencies of values
    occur in the intervals 36-40, 41-45, and 46-50.
  AnswerChoices: 16-20; 21-25; 26-30; 31-35; 36-40; 41-45; 46-50
  CorrectAnswer: 16-20
  AnswerTests: word= 16-20
  Hint: Look for the bin values corresponding to the tallest bar in the histogram.

- Class: exact_question
  Output: How many cars get 16-20 MPG in the city?
  CorrectAnswer: '25'
  AnswerTests: exact=25
  Hint: Look at the highest value on the y-axis that the '16-20' bar reaches.

- Class: figure
  Output: A red line has been drawn on our histogram illustrating the previous answer.
  Figure: mod1_histogram_add.R
  FigureType: addition

- Class: text
  Output: A special type of histogram is known as a STEM-AND-LEAF PLOT. This plot
    organizes numerical data in order of decimal place value. The left-hand column
    of the plot contains the STEMS, or the numerical values of the tens digit for
    each of the data points, organized vertically in increasing order. The LEAVES
    are located in the right-hand column of the plot and are the values of the ones
    digit for each data point of the corresponding stem, organized horizontally in
    increasing order. In a stem-and-leaf plot, the number of leaves is equal to the
    number of items in the data set. The easiest way to understand a stem-and-leaf
    plot is to see one!

- Class: video
  Output: Would you like to watch a brief YouTube video on stem-and-leaf plots?
  VideoLink: http://youtu.be/OaJXJduRiIE

- Class: figure
  Output: I have created a stem-and-leaf plot above (in the console) using the same values for the
    'mpgCity' variable as we just used for our histogram. As you can see, a stem-and-leaf
    plot is a useful type of histogram if you want to see the frequencies of specific
    values of the data. Often, there will only be one bin per tens digit, but in this
    case, R gives us the same bins as we saw in our histogram.
  Figure: mod1_stem.R
  FigureType: new

- Class: text
  Output: Now is a perfect time to introduce our last measure of central tendency,
    the MODE. The mode of a data set is the value that occurs most frequently.

- Class: exact_question
  Output: By looking at the stem-and-leaf plot above, what is the mode of the MPG?
  CorrectAnswer: '19'
  AnswerTests: exact=19
  Hint: Look for which number \repeats\" the most in the stem-and-leaf plot."

- Class: text
  Output: The measures of central tendency are very useful in briefly summarizing
    a data set, and finding the best representation of the central or average value
    of a data set. These are not the sole measures used to describe a data set, however.
    It is possible for very different data sets to exhibit the exact same values for
    their measures of central tendency. 'How is this possible?' you might ask. Well,
    let's take a look!

- Class: text
  Output: Another important property specific to each data set is a measure of how
    spread out or clustered the data values are. This is known as DISPERSION or VARIABILITY.
    Three measures of variability are interquartile range, variance, and standard
    deviation.

- Class: text
  Output: A BOX PLOT, also called a BOX-AND-WHISKER PLOT, is used to summarize the
    main descriptive statistics of a particular data set and will help illustrate
    the concept of variability. Remember that the R-command 'summary(cars$price)'
    returned values for the minimum, median, mean, and maximum of a data set, as well
    as two other items, which I promised to teach you about later on? Well, a box
    plot is used to visually represent the MINIMUM, FIRST QUARTILE (Q1), MEDIAN, THIRD
    QUARTILE (Q3), and MAXIMUM of a data set.

- Class: video
  Output: Would you like to watch a brief YouTube video on box-and-whisker plots?
  VideoLink: http://youtu.be/BXq5TFLvsVw

- Class: figure
  Output: 'Here I have created a box plot to represent the price data for each of
    the three car types: large, midsize, and small. You''ll notice that each of the
    3 figures is composed of a closed 4-sided \"box\" with \"whiskers\" on the top
    and bottom'
  Figure: mod1_boxplot.R
  FigureType: new

- Class: text
  Output: The height of each box is referred to as the INTERQUARTILE RANGE (IQR).
    The more variability within the data, the larger the IQR. On the other hand, less
    variability within the data means a smaller IQR. The bottom of the box in the
    box plot corresponds to the value of the first quartile (Q1), and the top of the
    box corresponds to the value of the third quartile (Q3). To calculate the value
    of the IQR, simply subtract the value of Q1 from that of Q3.

- Class: text
  Output: The whiskers, or lines, that extend above and below each box represent roughly
    the upper 25% and lower 25% of data points, respectively. The only exception is
    when there are outliers, which I'll explain shortly.

- Class: range_question
  Output: Looking at the box plot, what is the approximate interquartile range for
    the midsize vehicles?
  CorrectAnswer: 16- 20
  AnswerTests: range=16- 20
  Hint: Subtract the Q1 value from the Q3 value. The Q1 value is the minimum value
    contained in the box and the Q3 value is the maximum value contained in the box.

- Class: text
  Output: Let's take a closer look at how quartiles are calculated. We start by sorting
    the data from least to greatest, just like when calculating the median. The first
    quartile (Q1), also known at the 25th PERCENTILE (since 25% of the data points
    fall at or below this value), is simply the median of the first half of the sorted
    data. Likewise, the third quartile (Q3), also known as the 75th percentile, is
    the median of the second half of the sorted data.

- Class: figure
  Output: As shown in this plot, the blue horizontal line illustrates how to find
    the value for the first quartile. The green horizontal line illustrates how to
    find the value for the third quartile. The interquartile range is the range of
    data values that is contained in between these two lines.

- Class: figure
  Output: Look again at our box plot of price vs. car type. You may be thinking to
    yourself, 'What is that circle above the box plots for the midsize cars, and why
    is there no circle above the box plot for the large cars?' Those circles represent
    OUTLIERS in the data set. An OUTLIER is an observation that is unusual or extreme
    relative to the other values in the data set. Outliers are useful in identifying
    a heavy skew in a distribution, and may signify a data collection or data entry
    error to a scientist. There are many different conventions for identifying outliers
    within a data set.

  Output: When looking at the box plot, which car types appear to have outliers? Separate
    your answers with a comma.
  CorrectAnswer: small, midsize
  AnswerTests: word_many=small, midsize
  Hint: Look for the types of cars that correspond to the box plots with circles above
    or below them.

- Class: text
  Output: 'Since we have finished our introduction to the interquartile range, we
    will now take a look at the two other values used when describing the spread of
    the data: variance and standard deviation. Mathematically, VARIANCE is the average
    of the squared differences from the mean. Don''t worry if you find this a little
    confusing. Intuitively, variance just represents the total distance of the data
    from the mean of the data.'

- Class: text
  Output: A low variance indicates that the data points tend to be located near the
    mean value, while a high variance indicates that the data points are spread further
    from the mean.

- Class: text
  Output: A more conventional measure of variability is the STANDARD DEVIATION, which
    is calculated as the square root of the variance. Statisticians typically refer
    to standard deviation because it is expressed in the same units as the original
    data values. If you are interested in the details of how variance and standard
    deviation are calculated, I recommend taking a look at the following video.

- Class: video
  Output: Would you like to watch a brief YouTube video on variance and standard deviation?
  VideoLink: http://youtu.be/E4HAYd0QnRc

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Using the R command 'sd()', calculate the standard deviation of the data
    subset entitled 'mpg.midsize'.
  CorrectAnswer: sd(mpg.midsize)
  AnswerTests: swirl1cmd=sd(mpg.midsize)
  Hint: If you wanted the sd of 'x', you would type 'sd(x)'.

- Class: exact_question
  Output: Now that you have calculated the standard deviation of this data, can you
    tell me what is the variance of the data? To square a quantity in R, the notation
    is 'quantity^2', where the '^' symbol means 'to the power of'.
  CorrectAnswer: '3.593072'
  AnswerTests: exact=3.593072
  Hint: Variance is the standard deviation squared.

- Class: text
  Output: To demonstrate differences in variability, I will again refer to the box
    plot of car type vs. price.

- Class: figure
  Output: As you can see in the box plot, the data for prices of 'midsize' cars vary
    from around 15 to 62, encompassing a range of approximately 50. This is a great
    deal larger than the variation for 'small' cars which range from around 5 to 15,
    encompassing a range of approximately 10. Therefore, since the range is much greater
    for 'midsize' cars, prices of 'midsize' cars have much higher variability in comparison
    to the prices of 'small' cars.
  Figure: mod1_boxplot.R
  FigureType: new

- Class: text_question
  Output: Now it is your turn! Is the variability of prices of cars of type 'large'
    higher or lower than that of cars of type 'small'?
  CorrectAnswer: higher
  AnswerTests: word=higher
  Hint: Look to see if the range of cars of type 'large' is greater or less than that
    of cars of type 'small'.

- Class: text
  Output: While dispersion measures the variability from the mean in a data set, another
    important property is the shape of the distribution of the data. We will learn
    much more about distributions in one of my subsequent lessons, but for now just
    think of DISTRIBUTION as a histogram.

- Class: text
  Output: Histograms are particularly useful in viewing and describing the shape of
    the distribution of the data. A distribution of data may have a left skew, a right
    skew, or no skew at all. SKEWNESS is a measure of the extent to which the distribution
    of the data 'leans' to one side or the other.

- Class: figure
  Output: A distribution that has a left skew is one in which the left TAIL of the
    plot is longer. In other words, on a histogram the majority of the distribution
    is located to the right of the mean. This distribution is also said to be left-skewed.
    When a distribution is left-skewed, the value of the MEAN is less than that of
    the MEDIAN, and thus the MEAN is located further to the left of the distribution.
    In this plot, the green line represents the median and the blue line represents
    the mean.
  Figure: mod1_leftskew.R
  FigureType: new

- Class: figure
  Output: On the other hand, a distribution that has a right skew is one in which
    the right tail is longer, such that the majority of the data falls to the left
    of the mean, when viewed on the histogram. This distribution is said to be right-skewed.
    When a distribution is right-skewed, the value of the MEAN is greater than that
    of the MEDIAN, and thus the MEAN is located further to the right of the distribution.
    In this plot, the green line represents the median and the blue line represents
    the mean.
  Figure: mod1_rightskew.R
  FigureType: new

- Class: figure
  Output: A plot that has no skew is one in which the tails on both sides of the mean
    balance out, and is referred to as symmetric. When a distribution is symmetric,
    the MEAN and MEDIAN are approximately equal in value. In this plot, the green
    line represents the median and the blue line represents the mean. The green line
    is the only one visible since the mean and median are so close to the same value.
  Figure: mod1_symmetric.R
  FigureType: new

- Class: figure
  Output: Let's take a look back at the histogram we made earlier, which represents
    the distribution of the values for city MPG for each of the 54 cars from our 'cars'
    data set.
  Figure: mod1_histogram.R
  FigureType: new

- Class: mult_question
  Output: How would you classify the shape of the distribution represented by this
    histogram?
  AnswerChoices: Symmetric; Right-skewed; Left-skewed
  CorrectAnswer: Right-skewed
  AnswerTests: word= Right-skewed
  Hint: Look to see which tail extends further. The plot is said to be skewed in that
    direction.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Referring to the same histogram, and keeping in mind your answer to the
    previous question, would you expect the MEDIAN to be greater than, less than,
    or equal to the MEAN?
  AnswerChoices: Greater than; Less than; Equal to
  CorrectAnswer: Less than
  AnswerTests: word= Less than
  Hint: Keep in mind that data points that create a plot's long tail will tend to
    'pull' the mean in that direction. The median is not affected by how far away
    the data points are.

- Class: text
  Output: Up to this point, I have covered useful techniques to visualize numerical,
    or continuous variables, but what about categorical variables? Well, one useful
    way to display a single categorical variable is via a BAR GRAPH, in which the
    various categories lie on the x-axis and the numerical values corresponding to
    each category lie on the y-axis.

- Class: figure
  Output: 'Here is a BAR GRAPH representing the average price for each of the three
    car types: large, midsize, and small. Because there are numerous data points within
    each category, the height of each bar is the MEAN price ($1000s) of all of the
    cars within that category.'
  Figure: mod1_bargraph.R
  FigureType: new

- Class: text_order_question
  Output: According to the bar graph, which car type is the most expensive, on average?
    Which is the least expensive, on average? Answer the two questions in the same
    order with a comma separating the two answers.
  CorrectAnswer: midsize, small
  AnswerTests: word_order=midsize, small
  Hint: Look at the corresponding car type for the tallest bar to determine which
    car is the most expensive. Look at the corresponding car type for the shortest
    bar to determine which car is the least expensive.

- Class: figure
  Output: The 'midsize' bar has been highlighted green and is the most expensive on
    average. The 'small' bar has been highlighted blue and is the least expensive
    on average.

- Class: text
  Output: Up until now, every plot I have introduced has involved only one variable.
    But what if you are trying to analyze two variables? A SCATTER PLOT provides a
    comparative view of data for two numerical variables, with one on the x-axis and
    the other on the y-axis. This type of a plot is useful because it allows you to
    see whether two variables are related and to what degree.

- Class: figure
  Output: Here's an example of a scatter plot.
  Figure: mod1_scatter.R
  FigureType: new

- Class: mult_question
  Output: 'Of the three variables discussed previously: continuous, discrete, and
    categorical, which do you think would be most appropriate to use in a scatter
    plot?'
  AnswerChoices: Continuous; Discrete; Categorical
  CorrectAnswer: Continuous
  AnswerTests: word= Continuous
  Hint: Think about which of the three variable types has an indefinite number of
    possible values.
