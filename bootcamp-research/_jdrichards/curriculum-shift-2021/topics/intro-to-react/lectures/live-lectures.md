# React Live Lectures

For this portion of the curriculum, lectures will be given live by the
instructors and will be recorded and distributed. Take advantage of this to ask
the lecturer questions especially during moments when you need clarification on
what was just said. Don't be afraid to ask for something to be repeated!
