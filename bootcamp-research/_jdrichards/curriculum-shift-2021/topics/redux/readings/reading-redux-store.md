# Store

## Introduction

The **store** is the central element of Redux's architecture. It holds the
global **state** of an application.

The store is responsible for:

- updating an app's state via its **reducer**;
- broadcasting the state to an application's view layer via **subscription**;
- listening for **actions** that tell it how and when to change the global state
  of an application.

## Creating the store

The `redux` library provides us with a `createStore()` method, which takes up to
three arguments and returns a Redux `store`.

```js
createStore(reducer, [preloadedState], [enhancer]);
```

- `reducer` (required) - A reducing function that receives the app's current
  state and incoming actions, determines how to update the store's state, and
  returns the next state (more on this in a moment).
- `preLoadedState` (optional) - An `object` representing any application state
  that existed before the store was created.
- `enhancer` (optional) - A `function` that adds extra functionality to the
  store.

Here is an example of how to create a store:

```js
// store.js
import { createStore } from `redux`;
import reducer from './reducer.js';

const store = createStore(reducer);
```

## Store API

A Redux `store` is just an object that holds the application state, wrapped in a
minimalist API.

#### Store methods

- `getState()` - Returns the store's current state.
- `dispatch(action)` - Passes an `action` into the store's `reducer` telling it
  what information to update.
- `subscribe(callback)` - Registers callbacks to be triggered whenever the store
  updates. Returns a function, which when invoked, unsubscribes the callback
  function from the store.

## Updating the store

Store updates can only be triggered by dispatching **actions**:

```js
store.dispatch(action);
```

An `action` in Redux is just a plain object with:

- a `type` key indicating the action being performed, and
- optional payload keys containing any new information.

For example, if we were building a fruit stand application our store would
handle the inventory. We would use the following action to add an orange to the
app's state:

```js
// actions.js
const addOrange = {
  type: "ADD_FRUIT",
  fruit: "orange"
};
```

When `store.dispatch()` is called, the store passes its current `state`, along
with the `action` being dispatched, to the `reducer`. The `reducer` function
takes the two arguments (`state` and `action`) and returns the next `state`.
You'll read more on the `reducer` in the next reading, but for now, think of it
as a Redux app's traffic cop, routing new information to its rightful place in
the state.

Let's write a `reducer` for our fruit stand app:

```js
// reducer.js
const reducer = (state = [], action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case "ADD_FRUIT":
      return [...state, action.fruit];
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

export default reducer;
```

**NB**:

- The reducer's `state` parameter provides a default value; this is the
  **initial state** of our store prior to any actions. In this case, it's an
  empty array.
- In Redux, [**the state is immutable**][why-immutable], so the reducer must
  return a **new array or object** whenever the state changes.

Now that we've defined our app's reducing function, we can now `dispatch` the
`addOrange` action to our `store`:

```js
// store.js
import { createStore } from "redux";
import reducer from "./reducer.js";
import { addOrange } from "./actions.js";

const store = createStore(reducer);

store.getState(); // []
store.dispatch(addOrange);
store.getState(); // ['orange']
```

through [here][fruit-stand-01]!

## Subscribing to the store

Once the store has processed a `dispatch()`, it triggers all its subscribers.
Subscribers are callbacks that can be added to the store via `subscribe()`.

Let's define a callback `display` and subscribe it to our example's store.

```js
const display = () => {
  console.log(store.getState());
};

const unsubscribeDisplay = store.subscribe(display);
store.dispatch(addOrange); // ['orange', 'orange']

// ...later (when we are done displaying)
unsubscribeDisplay(); // display will no longer be invoked after store.dispatch()
```

In the example above, the store processed the dispatched action and then called
all of its subscribers in response. The only subscriber is our `display`
callback which logs the current state when called.

#### React components

Connecting our React view layer to the store is accomplished via
`store.subscribe()`. Let's define a React component `FruitStand` that takes the
app's store as a `prop` and subscribes its `forceUpdate()` method to the store.

```js
// src/components/FruitStand.js
import React from "react";

class FruitStand extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);

    /* Note: Subscribing `forceUpdate()` is not a recommended pattern and used
		for illustration purposes only. See the `NB` below. */
    this.forceUpdate = this.forceUpdate.bind(this);
    this.unsubscribe = this.props.store.subscribe(this.forceUpdate);
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <ul>
        {this.props.store.getState().map((fruit, idx) => (
          <li key={idx}>{fruit}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    );
  }

  // let's make sure that when we are done with our component
  // we unsubscribe any callbacks we registered to the store
  componentWillUnmount() {
    this.unsubscribe();
  }
}

export default FruitStand;
```

The idea is that by subscribing a React component to the store via its
`forceUpdate()` method, the store triggers re-rendering of the component with
the updated state every time it processes a `store.dispatch(action)` call. In
other words, `FruitStand` will re-render whenever the app state changes.

**NB**: Subscribing `forceUpdate()` tells a component to immediately re-render
every time the store's contents change. This pattern works but is a rather blunt
instrument for complex components, since re-rendering a parent causes
re-rendering of all its children. We'll learn more about the `react-redux`
library soon, which solves this problem via the `Provider / connect()` API.
