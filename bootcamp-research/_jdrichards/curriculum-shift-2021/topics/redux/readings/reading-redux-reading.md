# Redux

Tomorrow, you'll learn about Redux, a way to manage state in React applications.
It has fallen slightly out of favor because of "Hooks", which you'll learn
about on Wednesday. For now, please read:

* The entire [Introduction][1] to Redux
* The entire [Basic Tutorial][2] to Redux
* The [Redux Thunk][3] documentation page

Once you've read all of that, install the [Redux DevTools][4].
