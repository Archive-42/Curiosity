# Code of Conduct

The App Academy community is based on two foundational principles: integrity in your work and respect for others in the community. As an App Academy student, you are expected to abide by these principles at all times. Repeated failure to integrate these principles into your words and actions will result in your dismissal from App Academy.

## Principle #1: Integrity in Your Work

App Academy is a rigorous, difficult program. The only way to succeed at a/A is to give the daily assignments, readings, and lectures your full attention and focus. Additionally, the amount of effort you put into your work affects your fellow students' ability to learn and excel. For these reasons, we require that you abide by the following guidelines while at App Academy.

### Academic Integrity Guidelines

1. **Be on time.** During the curriculum, be sure to check in on Progress Tracker at between 7:50am and 8am PST in your campus' time zone, after lunch between 12:20pm and 12:30pm PST, and after the afternoon break between 2:35pm and 2:45pm PST. To fully participate in the day's work, you must be on time for each of these calls.<br><br>
If for any reason you are unable to be on time for the above described checkins, you are expected to communicate with your Cohort Assistant(CA) as soon as possible - preferably before missing the checkin.<br><br>
If you are unable to attend class on time due to illness, emergency, or extenuating circumstances, you are expected to communicate your absence to your Cohort Assistant as soon as you are able. Your CA will provide more specific information regarding policies for illness and emergency.

2. **Complete your assignments, and focus on your work.** To the very best of your ability, you must complete all assigned readings and video lectures, and stay focused and engaged with projects for their assigned hours. Failing to do the readings or view the lectures for the following day pulls not only you, but your coding partner for the day down. Additionally, App Academy's curriculum is cumulative -- if you fall behind, you will continue to find yourself more and more behind as the program progresses. Stay on top of the work.

3. **Do not plagiarize.** While it is both normal and acceptable to view other code bases to find inspiration for your own work, plagiarism is not tolerated. Any act of plagiarism is deemed an infraction of the code of conduct and could result in immediate dismissal from the course.

4. **Prioritize understanding over brute force completion.** This guideline may seem counterintuitive to the previous guideline, but what matters most in this program is firm understanding of the concepts at hand. If you must make a choice between completion without understanding, and understanding without completion, always choose the latter. What is not acceptable is to walk away from your work without making every effort to thoroughly understand and complete the tasks at hand.

5. **Ask for help when you need it.** You will be challenged at App Academy. You will, at some point, be confused and lost. This is normal and natural. We want you to make every effort to understand on your own, but if you find yourself stuck, we also expect you to ask for help from TAs, instructors, and your fellow students, so that you do not fall behind.

6. **Focus full-time on App Academy.** App Academy is entirely immersive, and to ensure your success in this course, you must be solely focused on a/A for the duration of the program. Although it may be difficult financially, we expect that you will not hold any full or part-time work during a/A, even if it does not directly conflict with instructional hours. Additionally, we expect that you will minimize other non-work conflicts to the best of your ability.

### Consequences and Accountability

#### **Assessments**

During the SWE - Online coding curriculum, you will take a total of six assessments. These assessments are designed to gauge how well you've mastered the material and whether or not you're keeping up with the work.

- Failing three assessments, including any assessment labeled a retake, is grounds for dismissal from App Academy
- Cheating on any assessment is grounds for immediate dismissal from App Academy

#### **Strikes**

In addition to assessments, instructors and TAs may assign "strikes" for behaviors in violation of the guidelines outlined above. Strike-worthy offenses include (but are not limited to) missing roll call, having your phone or laptop out during class time, and failure to turn in required assignments. Accruing 10 strikes during the curriculum is grounds for dismissal.

#### **Job Search Curriculum Strikes**

After the conclusion of the coding curriculum, you will enter the job search curriculum. Your coding curriculum strikes will be nullified at this time, and you will become accountable to the job search strike system until you either find a job, or your job search eligibility period has expired.

Strike-worthy offenses during the job search curriculum include (but are not limited to) failure to respond to emails from your career coach, missing roll call, missing deadlines set by your career coach, and leaving your designated job search area (as defined by you and your coach) without the approval of your coach. Accruing 10 strikes is grounds for App Academy to collect your tuition immediately.

Strikes and assessments are integral parts of the App Academy system. Thoroughly review the Strike Policy and the Assessments Readings before continuing.

### App Academy Intellectual Property

Although not related directly to classroom behavior, our final note on integrity is that App Academy is granting you access to our curriculum and other proprietary materials for the sole purpose of your personal training and education. Any unauthorized uses of the curriculum are in violation of the integrity you've agreed to uphold while at App Academy, and furthermore is liable for prosecution under the fullest extent of California and Federal law.

## Principle #2: Respect for Others

App Academy strives to provide an environment that is safe and supportive for all students. As a part of the a/A community, we expect that you will help to create such an environment for your peers. Creating such a space is simultaneously simple and complex; the core principle of respect for every other person in this space is what should guide your behavior. At times, it may not be clear to you how to best act out that respect. We ask that all students mold their behavior and words to the following guidelines.

### Guidelines for Respectful Behavior

1. **Treat your coding partners with professionalism.** You will spend the vast majority of your time at App Academy pair programming, usually with a new partner each day. You may not like each person you work with, however, you are expected to treat each other with the same professionalism you would treat a colleague in the workplace.<br><br>
If you encounter conflict, we expect you to address it in a mature, respectful way, just as you would on the job. If you find yourself unable to come to a resolution, App Academy TAs and instructors can act as mediators -- however, we encourage you to view difficult partner experiences as practice for the professional world, and make every effort to come to a consensus before getting staff involved.

2. **Take feedback with grace.** In the intense App Academy environment, all of our flaws and bad habits tend to surface. If a fellow student or a staff member points out an area in which you can improve either technically or interpersonally, we expect that you will listen with open ears and incorporate this feedback into your work and behavior as best as possible. Defensiveness is not productive and has no place at App Academy. We encourage you to view these moments as challenges to be faced head-on; constructive feedback is a gift to you and gives you a chance to reflect and improve.

3. **Give feedback with empathy.** Receiving critical feedback can be challenging, and we expect you to recognize that when offering it. Before approaching a fellow student with advice for improvement, reflect thoughtfully and find phrasing that tells your peer three things: concrete example(s) of their problematic behavior, the way(s) in which this behavior impacted you as a partner or peer, and concrete actions they can take in the future to improve upon this behavior. If you are struggling to find the right words, App Academy staff are available as sounding boards.

4. **Exercise self-awareness in your interactions with others.** It is very easy to become self-involved and tunnel-visioned in the midst of the intense stress and workload of App Academy. We expect, however, that you will take on the additional challenge of maintaining a high level of empathy and self-awareness towards your fellow students. Ask yourself frequently how your words and actions are affecting the people around you. Reflect on your own biases (which we all hold); are you treating people differently based on a characteristic such as gender, physical appearance, race, or something else? If you find this to be the case, step back and think about how you can do better.

5. **Treat every member of the a/A community with a high level of respect, as you would want to be treated.** All members of our community -- staff, students, and alumni -- are expected to treat all others in the community respectfully, regardless of their backgrounds, performance in the course, interpersonal conflicts that may have arisen in the past, or any personal characteristics such as gender, race, sexual orientation, trans status, religion, national origin, body size or shape, or disability status. For more detail on this, see the guidelines on Unacceptable Behaviors below.

### Unacceptable Behaviors

App Academy is dedicated to creating a space that is supportive for all members of our community, regardless of their gender, race, religion, national origin, body size or shape, trans status, sexual orientation, disability status, or any other personal characteristic that may marginalize them in some way. A key piece of creating this space is to actively address any harassment that arises. Harassment can take many forms, including:

1. **Physical and sexual harassment.** Physical harassment includes violence towards another person such as shoving, punching, or aggressively invading another's personal space. Sexual harassment includes non-consensual sexual comments, touching, sexual advances, and stalking behavior (regardless of the genders of the harasser and the harassed). Additionally, overtly sexual images, jokes, or discussions constitute sexual harassment, even if the behavior is not directed toward a particular individual. Physical and sexual harassment has no place at App Academy and is grounds for immediate dismissal from the program.

2. **Overt verbal harassment.** This includes insulting a fellow student, aggressively cursing at another person (i.e., not just including a curse word in your speech, but attacking another with these words), and using your words to demean another person. Using racial epithets, slurs directed at a marginalized group, or other language meant to demean another person is also considered overt verbal harassment. Depending on the severity of the offense, verbal harassment may either be grounds for dismissal or, in less serious cases, may require intervention as outlined in the Resolution Process below.

3. **Inadvertently exclusionary language/behavior ("micro-aggressions").** This behavior is harder to pinpoint, but can be just as damaging as overt harassment, particularly if it occurs many times over. Exclusionary language and behavior, sometimes referred to as micro-aggressions, result when one person has an internalized bias against a marginalized group such as women, people of color, queer people, etc., and interacts with a member of that group in a subtly derogatory way.<br><br>
By their nature, micro-aggressions are subtle and sometimes even well-meaning. However, to create a community that is truly inclusive of everyone, it is important for all a/A staff, students, and alumni to confront the biases that lead to these micro-aggressions. Reports of exclusionary behavior such as those outlined above will be addressed promptly using the Resolution Process, outlined below.

### The Resolution Process

App Academy takes a restorative approach to resolving any issues of inappropriate, exclusionary, or harassing behavior behavior, meaning that we seek to fully resolve any incidents to the satisfaction of any and all parties harmed by the behavior, and pending this resolution, we seek to reintegrate all persons into our community whenever possible. That being said, the safety of our community comes first, and we will dismiss any person who is deemed to be an ongoing threat to the safety of the App Academy community. More information about the disciplinary committee in this guide.

The process for reporting Code of Conduct violations at App Academy is as follows:

1. **Reporting Violations to the Code of Conduct.** Students who wish to report behavior that is inappropriate, harassing, or in any way in violation of the guidelines outlined above may do so anonymously or non-anonymously using this [form][community-report]. Your report is fully anonymous unless you choose to include your name in the report -- no staff member at a/A will be able to tell who submitted the report. Students may also submit reports via nightly student feedback reports, emails, slack messages, or directly in conversation with an App Academy staff member.

2. **Addressing Anonymous Reports.** If a report is submitted anonymously, a/A staff will speak with the accused harasser as soon as possible. Staff will gather as much information as possible, and decide on consequences that will resolve the inappropriate behavior in a productive way aligned with the goal of restorative justice. These consequences may include required readings on the subject of the harassment, such as implicit bias, sexism, racism, etc., daily check-ins with staff about what the student in question is doing to do better with future coding partners, etc. In severe cases, the student may be dismissed from App Academy.

3. **Addressing Non-Anonymous Reports.** If you include your name in your report, a/A staff will first follow up with you to decide next steps. We believe that as the affected party, you have the right to have a say in how such incidents are resolved. You will be invited (but not required) to sit down with the individual whose behavior you've reported for a mediation and/or to suggest consequences that will productively resolve the incident. Thereafter, App Academy staff will speak with the individual in question to discuss these consequences and/or mediate a discussion between the two of you.

4. **Expulsion from App Academy.** Whenever possible, App Academy seeks to reintegrate individuals who are found in violation of the Code of Conduct into the community. However, we will not do so if it puts other students or staff at risk or if the individual in question is unwilling to follow through with assigned consequences that resulted from the incident. In cases where reintegration is not possible, individuals who are found to be in violation of this policy will be (and have been in the past) dismissed from App Academy. Should you be dismissed because of unacceptable behavior, you will be charged pro-rated tuition.
