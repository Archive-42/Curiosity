# Learning Objectives

## Big-O, Memoization, & Tabulation

1. Order the common complexity classes according to their growth rate
2. Identify the complexity classes of common sort methods
3. Identify complexity classes of code
4. Apply memoization to recursive problems to make them less than polynomial time.
5. Apply tabulation to iterative problems to make them less than polynomial time.
