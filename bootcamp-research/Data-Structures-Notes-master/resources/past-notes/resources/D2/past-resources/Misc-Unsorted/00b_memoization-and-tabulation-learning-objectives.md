# Memoization And Tabulation Learning Objectives

**The objective of this lesson** is to give you a couple of ways to optimize a
computation (algorithm) from a higher complexity class to a lower complexity
class. Being able to optimize algorithms is an essential for interviewing
software engineers.

At the end of this, you will be able to

1. Apply memoization to recursive problems to make them less than polynomial
   time.
2. Apply tabulation to iterative problems to make them less than polynomial
   time.
