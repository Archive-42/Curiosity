# Installing Google Chrome

Here at App Academy, our browser of choice is Google Chrome. This isn't super
important at the beginning of the course, but once we get into frontend
development (writing code that runs in a web browser) the Chrome DevTools will
be crucial for debugging every manner of issue. Other browsers do include 
Devtools, but they may work slightly differently than the ones in Google Chrome.

If you want to follow along with instructors and our curriculum you will want
to make sure you install Google Chrome or it's open source equivalent Chromium.

To install Google Chrome, download the necessary files and follow the
instructions on the [Google Chrome website][chrome-dl].

## macOS

macOS users should just download the Google Chrome DMG (Disk image) file and 
double click on it to mount it as a drive.  Then drag the Chrome icon to your
Applications Folder, then you can eject the Google Chrome Disk Image by dragging
it to the Trash.

## Windows

Windows users should run the downloaded Chrome installer application, and
follow the instructions.

## Ubuntu

Ubuntu users should download the .deb version of Google Chrome and double click
on it from the Downloads folder in the file manager.
