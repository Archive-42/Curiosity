        "## Python Numbers\n",
        "Python has several built-in types for general programming. It also supports custom types known as Classes. Not all classes are technically Types as in Type Theory, but it is a good way to start thinking about them. A true Pythonista can create their own type and define what math means for that type. Basically, we can invent math. More on this in the classes module.\n",

        "- Integer `int`: Python supports big integers - this is a colossal understatement. Python can handle an integer so big it takes all of your available RAM.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Float `float`: Python supports 64bit floating point approximation of real numbers.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Complex `complex`: Python supports Complex Numbers, like in most engineering fields the letter j is used in Python to distinguish values on the complex plane.\n",
