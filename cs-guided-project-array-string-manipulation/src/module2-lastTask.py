# Imagine a school that children attend for years. In each year, there are a certain number of groups started, marked with the letters. So if years = 7 and groups = 4For the first year, the groups are 1a, 1b, 1c, 1d, and for the last year, the groups are 7a, 7b, 7c, 7d.

# Write a function that returns the groups in the school by year (as a string), separated with a comma and space in the form of "1a, 1b, 1c, 1d, 2a, 2b (....) 6d, 7a, 7b, 7c, 7d".

# Examples:

# csSchoolYearsAndGroups(years = 7, groups = 4) âžž "1a, 1b, 1c, 1d, 2a, 2b, 2c, 2d, 3a, 3b, 3c, 3d, 4a, 4b, 4c, 4d, 5a, 5b, 5c, 5d, 6a, 6b, 6c, 6d, 7a, 7b, 7c, 7d"
# Notes:

# 1 <= years <= 10
# 1 <= groups <=26
# [execution time limit] 4 seconds (py3)

# [input] integer years

# [input] integer groups

# [output] string


def schoolGroups(years, groups):
    alphabet = list(map(chr, range(97, 123)))
    emp_list = []
    for year in range(1, years + 1):
        for group in range(0, groups):
            emp_list.append(f"{year}{alphabet[group]}")
    # print(emp_list)
    return ", ".join(emp_list)


print(schoolGroups(1, 4))
print(schoolGroups(6, 7))
