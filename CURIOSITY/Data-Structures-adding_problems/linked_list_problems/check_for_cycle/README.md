# Check If A Linked List Has A Cycle

Write a function that, given a linked list, returns a boolean indicating whether
or not a the given linked list contains a cycle. A linked list with a cycle
might look like this:

```
[1]->[2]->[3]->[4]
           ^    |
           |    V
          [6]<-[5]
```

More formally, a linked list contains a cycle if it connects back into itself,
such that it doesn't have a tail. 

Analyze the time and space complexity of your solution.
