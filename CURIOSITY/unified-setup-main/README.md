# Setting up your computer for AppAcademy

In order to be successful in the course it's good that your computer be setup
in a very specific way so as to not waste your time fighting the setup of tools
and applications, so you can concentrate on the new material you are learning.

While you are learning how to setup Node.JS or Python, and that can be a useful
skill, we are more concerned with learning to program in these languages than
we are how to install the tools and languages on your computer.

First head to the guide for your particular operating system. This will give you
an overview of anything in particular you should be aware of for your system.

From there you can proceed to the individual sections for installing Google
Chrome, Visual Studio Code, Node.JS, Python, and Docker.

> Important, if you have an Apple Silicon Mac be sure to read the
> [Apple Silicon Mac Addendum] before you start installing software.
