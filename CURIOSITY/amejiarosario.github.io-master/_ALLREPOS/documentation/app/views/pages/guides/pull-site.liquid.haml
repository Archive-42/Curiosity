  This function allows you to retrieve a wagon site from a hosted location (a LocomotiveCMS engine).

  Create a new site with wagon

      cd ~/workspace
      wagon init mysite
      cd mysite
      bundle install

  Edit `config/deploy.yml` to configure the site you want to pull, on the production environment.

  Run the pull command

      bundle exec wagon pull production

  The mysite folder will be updated with all the site from the engine.

  Test it

      bundle exec wagon serve

  Then run your browser on http://0.0.0.0:3333

  Note: Because all the assets are compiled in the engine, you won't get the sass / coffeescript sources.
