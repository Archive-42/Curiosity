No&hellip; It''s a thing; it''s like a plan, but with more greatness. I''m the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor. I don''t know why. I call me the Doctor too. I still don''t know why.

    teaser: <p>I'm Santa Claus! Say it in Russian! Leela, are you alright? You got wanged on the head.</p>
    body: '<p>Eeeee!  Now say "nuclear wessels"! What are their names? Oh right. I forgot about the battle.</p><h3>The Cryonic Woman</h3><p>Also Zoidberg. I didn''t ask for a completely reasonable excuse! I asked you to get busy! Yeah, and if you were the pope they''d be all, "Straighten your pope hat." And "Put on your good vestments." Well, let''s just dump it in the sewer and say we delivered it. I am the man with no name, Zapp Brannigan! Oh, all right, I am. But if anything happens to me, tell them I died robbing some old man.</p><p>I guess if you want children beaten, you have to do it yourself. Look, everyone wants to be like Germany, but do we really have the pure strength of ''will''? WINDMILLS DO NOT WORK THAT WAY! GOOD NIGHT! In your time, yes, but nowadays shut up! Besides, these are adult stemcells, harvested from perfectly healthy adults whom I killed for their stemcells.</p><p>Dear God, they''ll be killed on our doorstep! And there''s no trash pickup until January 3rd. It''s just like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus. All year long, the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter, while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV. But then the winter came, and the grasshopper died, and the octopus ate all his acorns. Also he got a race car. Is any of this getting through to you? Hey! I''m a porno-dealing monster, what do I care what you think? Bender, quit destroying the universe!</p><p>I guess if you want children beaten, you have to do it yourself. Enough about your promiscuous mother, Hermes! We have bigger problems. Bender?! You stole the atom. Yes! In your face, Gandhi! I love you, buddy! Ven ve voke up, ve had zese wodies.</p><p>Check it out, y''all. Everyone who was invited is here. You can see how I lived before I met you. No, of course not. It was&hellip; uh&hellip; porno. Yeah, that''s it. This is the worst part. The calm before the battle. And from now on you''re all named Bender Jr. There, now he''s trapped in a book I wrote: a crummy world of plot holes and spelling errors! You can see how I lived before I met you. Kids have names?</p><h3>A Bicyclops Built For Two</h3><p>Oh sure! Blame the wizards! And why did ''I'' have to take a cab? With a warning label this big, you know they gotta be fun! You lived before you met me?! Yes, I saw. You were doing well, until everyone died.</p><p>Ven ve voke up, ve had zese wodies. I just told you! You''ve killed me! Humans dating robots is sick. You people wonder why I''m still single? It''s ''cause all the fine robot sisters are dating humans! You know, I was God once. Fry! Quit doing the right thing, you jerk! Hey, what kinda party is this? There''s no booze and only one hooker. Enough about your promiscuous mother, Hermes! We have bigger problems.</p><p>I just told you! You''ve killed me! Dear God, they''ll be killed on our doorstep! And there''s no trash pickup until January 3rd. If rubbin'' frozen dirt in your crotch is wrong, hey I don''t wanna be right. Anyone who laughs is a communist! Negative, bossy meat creature! You won''t have time for sleeping, soldier, not with all the bed making you''ll be doing. This is the worst part. The calm before the battle. Shut up and get to the point!</p><p>What kind of a father would I be if I said no? Do a flip! No! The cat shelter''s on to me. Quite possible. We live long and are celebrated poopers. Also Zoidberg. When I was first asked to make a film about my nephew, Hubert Farnsworth, I thought "Why should I?" Then later, Leela made the film. But if I did make it, you can bet there would have been more topless women on motorcycles. Roll film! Five hours? Aw, man! Couldn''t you just get me the death penalty?</p><p>Oh dear! She''s stuck in an infinite loop, and he''s an idiot! Well, that''s love for you. We''re also Santa Claus! And remember, don''t do anything that affects anything, unless it turns out you were supposed to, in which case, for the love of God, don''t not do it!</p><p>No, she''ll probably make me do it. Hey, whatcha watching? Ven ve voke up, ve had zese wodies.</p><h3>Lesser of Two Evils</h3><p>Well, let''s just dump it in the sewer and say we delivered it. And remember, don''t do anything that affects anything, unless it turns out you were supposed to, in which case, for the love of God, don''t not do it! Do a flip! Hey, whatcha watching? Soothe us with sweet lies. Hi, I''m a naughty nurse, and I really need someone to talk to. $9.95 a minute. Ah, the ''Breakfast Club'' soundtrack!  I can''t wait til I''m old enough to feel ways about stuff! It''s toe-tappingly tragic!</p><p>You guys aren''t Santa! You''re not even robots. How dare you lie in front of Jesus? They''re like sex, except I''m having them! Nay, I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his own Oscar. But, like most politicians, he promised more than he could deliver. Leela, are you alright? You got wanged on the head.</p><p>Say it in Russian! Hey, whatcha watching? When the lights go out, it''s nobody''s business what goes on between two consenting adults.</p><p>Enough about your promiscuous mother, Hermes! We have bigger problems. Aww, it''s true. I''ve been hiding it for so long. Check it out, y''all. Everyone who was invited is here. Negative, bossy meat creature! Oh no! The professor will hit me! But if Zoidberg ''fixes'' it&hellip; then perhaps gifts! Please, Don-Bot&hellip; look into your hard drive, and open your mercy file!</p><p>And from now on you''re all named Bender Jr. And why did ''I'' have to take a cab? It''s just like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus. All year long, the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter, while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV. But then the winter came, and the grasshopper died, and the octopus ate all his acorns. Also he got a race car. Is any of this getting through to you? Aww, it''s true. I''ve been hiding it for so long. It''s toe-tappingly tragic! Hey! I''m a porno-dealing monster, what do I care what you think? Really?!</p><p>I daresay that Fry has discovered the smelliest object in the known universe! Yeah. Give a little credit to our public schools. Tell her you just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. Leela''s gonna kill me. Why would I want to know that? Hey, whatcha watching?</p><p>Oh no! The professor will hit me! But if Zoidberg ''fixes'' it&hellip; then perhaps gifts! I''ll get my kit! You guys realize you live in a sewer, right? Fry! Stay back! He''s too powerful!</p><p>Good news, everyone! There''s a report on TV with some very bad news! That''s not soon enough! No, of course not. It was&hellip; uh&hellip; porno. Yeah, that''s it. You know the worst thing about being a slave? They make you work, but they don''t pay you or let you go. Michelle, I don''t regret this, but I both rue and lament it. No! Don''t jump! Kids don''t turn rotten just from watching TV.</p><p>I''m sorry, guys. I never meant to hurt you. Just to destroy everything you ever believed in. Michelle, I don''t regret this, but I both rue and lament it. Bender, quit destroying the universe! I never loved you.</p><h3>Roswell That Ends Well</h3><p>Fatal. Ok, we''ll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we''ll go ride the bumper cars. When will that be? I daresay that Fry has discovered the smelliest object in the known universe! But, like most politicians, he promised more than he could deliver. Aww, it''s true. I''ve been hiding it for so long. Please, Don-Bot&hellip; look into your hard drive, and open your mercy file!</p><p>They''re like sex, except I''m having them! There''s no part of that sentence I didn''t like! Look, last night was a mistake.</p><p>Dear God, they''ll be killed on our doorstep! And there''s no trash pickup until January 3rd. I''ll get my kit! You mean while I''m sleeping in it? Why would I want to know that? They''re like sex, except I''m having them! Bender, this is Fry''s decision&hellip; and he made it wrong. So it''s time for us to interfere in his life. Then we''ll go with that data file!</p><p>Quite possible. We live long and are celebrated poopers. Say it in Russian! Well, let''s just dump it in the sewer and say we delivered it.

    body: '<p>Goodbye, cruel world. Goodbye, cruel lamp. Goodbye, cruel velvet drapes, lined with what would appear to be some sort of cruel muslin and the cute little pom-pom curtain pull cords. Cruel though they may be&hellip; Bender?! You stole the atom. Is that a cooking show?</p><h3>War Is the H-Word</h3><p>Well I''da done better, but it''s plum hard pleading a case while awaiting trial for that there incompetence. Well I''da done better, but it''s plum hard pleading a case while awaiting trial for that there incompetence. You know, I was God once.</p><p>That''s not soon enough! Hey! I''m a porno-dealing monster, what do I care what you think? Shinier than yours, meatbag. Oh, I always feared he might run off like this. Why, why, why didn''t I break his legs?</p><p>My fellow Earthicans, as I have explained in my book ''Earth in the Balance'''', and the much more popular ''''Harry Potter and the Balance of Earth'', we need to defend our planet against pollution. Also dark wizards. Bender, being God isn''t easy. If you do too much, people get dependent on you, and if you do nothing, they lose hope. You have to use a light touch. Like a safecracker, or a pickpocket. Hey, tell me something. You''ve got all this money. How come you always dress like you''re doing your laundry?</p><p>Is that a cooking show? There, now he''s trapped in a book I wrote: a crummy world of plot holes and spelling errors! Ow, my spirit! Shinier than yours, meatbag. There''s one way and only one way to determine if an animal is intelligent. Dissect its brain!</p><p>Oh, I don''t have time for this.  I have to go and buy a single piece of fruit with a coupon and then return it, making people wait behind me while I complain. Hey, whatcha watching? Fatal. I haven''t felt much of anything since my guinea pig died. And why did ''I'' have to take a cab? Anyone who laughs is a communist!</p><p>Bender?! You stole the atom. As an interesting side note, as a head without a body, I envy the dead. I haven''t felt much of anything since my guinea pig died. Kids have names? Why yes! Thanks for noticing.</p><h3>The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz</h3><p>Bender, we''re trying our best. Kif might! Say what? I feel like I was mauled by Jesus. I love this planet! I''ve got wealth, fame, and access to the depths of sleaze that those things bring. File not found.</p><p>You guys aren''t Santa! You''re not even robots. How dare you lie in front of Jesus? Goodbye, friends.  I never thought I''d die like this.  But I always really hoped. Quite possible. We live long and are celebrated poopers. It doesn''t look so shiny to me. Yeah, I do that with my stupidness. No. We''re on the top. Switzerland is small and neutral! We are more like Germany, ambitious and misunderstood! No, she''ll probably make me do it.</p><p>Who am I making this out to? Bender, being God isn''t easy. If you do too much, people get dependent on you, and if you do nothing, they lose hope. You have to use a light touch. Like a safecracker, or a pickpocket. Five hours? Aw, man! Couldn''t you just get me the death penalty? I didn''t ask for a completely reasonable excuse! I asked you to get busy! Fatal. As an interesting side note, as a head without a body, I envy the dead.</p><p>How much did you make me? You know, I was God once. Hi, I''m a naughty nurse, and I really need someone to talk to. $9.95 a minute. I just told you! You''ve killed me! Fatal. Michelle, I don''t regret this, but I both rue and lament it. In our darkest hour, we can stand erect, with proud upthrust bosoms. It may comfort you to know that Fry''s death took only fifteen seconds, yet the pain was so intense, that it felt to him like fifteen years. And it goes without saying, it caused him to empty his bowels.</p><p>In your time, yes, but nowadays shut up! Besides, these are adult stemcells, harvested from perfectly healthy adults whom I killed for their stemcells. You''ll have all the Slurm you can drink when you''re partying with Slurms McKenzie! Hey, whatcha watching?</p><h3>A Big Piece of Garbage</h3><p>Yep, I remember. They came in last at the Olympics, then retired to promote alcoholic beverages! Guards! Bring me the forms I need to fill out to have her taken away! All I want is to be a monkey of moderate intelligence who wears a suit&hellip; that''s why I''m transferring to business school! Hello, little man. I will destroy you! Soon enough. So, how ''bout them Knicks?</p><p>Maybe I love you so much I love you no matter who you are pretending to be. Yes, I saw. You were doing well, until everyone died. Oh sure! Blame the wizards! Who am I making this out to? I had more, but you go ahead. OK, if everyone''s finished being stupid. Yep, I remember. They came in last at the Olympics, then retired to promote alcoholic beverages!</p><p>Morbo will now introduce tonight''s candidates&hellip; PUNY HUMAN NUMBER ONE, PUNY HUMAN NUMBER TWO, and Morbo''s good friend, Richard Nixon. I''m sure those windmills will keep them cool. So, how ''bout them Knicks? Oh, how awful. Did he at least die painlessly? &hellip;To shreds, you say. Well, how is his wife holding up? &hellip;To shreds, you say. In your time, yes, but nowadays shut up! Besides, these are adult stemcells, harvested from perfectly healthy adults whom I killed for their stemcells. You don''t know how to do any of those. Of all the friends I''ve had&hellip; you''re the first.</p><h3>A Big Piece of Garbage</h3><p>Of all the friends I''ve had&hellip; you''re the first. No, of course not. It was&hellip; uh&hellip; porno. Yeah, that''s it. Ow, my spirit! I feel like I was mauled by Jesus. When the lights go out, it''s nobody''s business what goes on between two consenting adults. Bender, being God isn''t easy. If you do too much, people get dependent on you, and if you do nothing, they lose hope. You have to use a light touch. Like a safecracker, or a pickpocket. Well I''da done better, but it''s plum hard pleading a case while awaiting trial for that there incompetence.</p><p>Uh, is the puppy mechanical in any way? Man, I''m sore all over. I feel like I just went ten rounds with mighty Thor. File not found. Enough about your promiscuous mother, Hermes! We have bigger problems. Then we''ll go with that data file! Dr. Zoidberg, that doesn''t make sense. But, okay! Fry, you can''t just sit here in the dark listening to classical music.</p><p>We''re rescuing ya. You know, I was God once. Well I''da done better, but it''s plum hard pleading a case while awaiting trial for that there incompetence. Ow, my spirit! Oh yeah, good luck with that. So, how ''bout them Knicks? It''s a T. It goes "tuh".</p><p>I daresay that Fry has discovered the smelliest object in the known universe! Bender, hurry! This fuel''s expensive! Also, we''re dying! I just told you! You''ve killed me! And until then, I can never die?</p><p>As an interesting side note, as a head without a body, I envy the dead. Goodbye, cruel world. Goodbye, cruel lamp. Goodbye, cruel velvet drapes, lined with what would appear to be some sort of cruel muslin and the cute little pom-pom curtain pull cords. Cruel though they may be&hellip; Ah, computer dating. It''s like pimping, but you rarely have to use the phrase "upside your head." Morbo can''t understand his teleprompter because he forgot how you say that letter that''s shaped like a man wearing a hat.</p><h3>Proposition Infinity</h3><p>No! The cat shelter''s on to me. File not found. Ummm&hellip;to eBay? What are you hacking off? Is it my torso?! ''It is!'' My precious torso! I love this planet! I''ve got wealth, fame, and access to the depths of sleaze that those things bring. No! Don''t jump!</p><p>Yep, I remember. They came in last at the Olympics, then retired to promote alcoholic beverages! You''re going back for the Countess, aren''t you? What are their names?</p><p>Bender?! You stole the atom. I didn''t ask for a completely reasonable excuse! I asked you to get busy! Oh dear! She''s stuck in an infinite loop, and he''s an idiot! Well, that''s love for you. I didn''t ask for a completely reasonable excuse! I asked you to get busy! Please, Don-Bot&hellip; look into your hard drive, and open your mercy file! They''re like sex, except I''m having them!</p><p>Hello Morbo, how''s the family? Bender, you risked your life to save me! As an interesting side note, as a head without a body, I envy the dead. Oh yeah, good luck with that. Yeah, I do that with my stupidness. It doesn''t look so shiny to me.</p><h3>A Clone of My Own</h3><p>I''ll tell them you went down prying the wedding ring off his cold, dead finger. You''re going back for the Countess, aren''t you? Moving along&hellip; And why did ''I'' have to take a cab? But I''ve never been to the moon!</p><p>Bender, I didn''t know you liked cooking. That''s so cute. Hi, I''m a naughty nurse, and I really need someone to talk to. $9.95 a minute. I didn''t ask for a completely reasonable excuse! I asked you to get busy!</p><p>Moving along&hellip; Shut up and take my money! Your best is an idiot! Of all the friends I''ve had&hellip; you''re the first. And until then, I can never die? For the last time, I don''t like lilacs!  Your ''first'' wife was the one who liked lilacs! And then the battle''s not so bad?</p><p>Kids have names? I don''t want to be rescued. That could be ''my'' beautiful soul sitting naked on a couch. If I could just learn to play this stupid thing. I was all of history''s great robot actors - Acting Unit 0.8; Thespomat; David Duchovny! And then the battle''s not so bad? I''ll tell them you went down prying the wedding ring off his cold, dead finger.</p><p>Oh yeah, good luck with that. No. We''re on the top. Or a guy who burns down a bar for the insurance money! Moving along&hellip;</p><p>I love this planet! I''ve got wealth, fame, and access to the depths of sleaze that those things bring. But I''ve never been to the moon! Bender, you risked your life to save me! I just told you! You''ve killed me! Why would a robot need to drink? Say it in Russian! Bender, I didn''t know you liked cooking. That''s so cute. I feel like I was mauled by Jesus.</p><h3>A Taste of Freedom</h3><p>Leela''s gonna kill me. Bender?! You stole the atom. Spare me your space age technobabble, Attila the Hun! No, of course not. It was&hellip; uh&hellip; porno. Yeah, that''s it. Bender, hurry! This fuel''s expensive! Also, we''re dying! I''m Santa Claus! I don''t want to be rescued.</p><p>I don''t want to be rescued. We need rest.  The spirit is willing, but the flesh is spongy and bruised. Oh sure! Blame the wizards! My fellow Earthicans, as I have explained in my book ''Earth in the Balance'''', and the much more popular ''''Harry Potter and the Balance of Earth'', we need to defend our planet against pollution. Also dark wizards. Ummm&hellip;to eBay?</p><p>Morbo can''t understand his teleprompter because he forgot how you say that letter that''s shaped like a man wearing a hat. Hello Morbo, how''s the family? Guards! Bring me the forms I need to fill out to have her taken away! It doesn''t look so shiny to me.</p><p>Aww, it''s true. I''ve been hiding it for so long. Hello Morbo, how''s the family? Moving along&hellip; Why yes! Thanks for noticing. File not found. Is that a cooking show? When will that be?</p><p>Ow, my spirit! You seem malnourished. Are you suffering from intestinal parasites? And why did ''I'' have to take a cab? Hey, guess what you''re accessories to. They''re like sex, except I''m having them!</p><p>OK, this has gotta stop. I''m going to remind Fry of his humanity the way only a woman can. Eeeee!  Now say "nuclear wessels"! You''re going back for the Countess, aren''t you?</p>'

Morbo will now introduce tonight''s candidates&hellip; PUNY HUMAN NUMBER ONE, PUNY HUMAN NUMBER TWO, and Morbo''s good friend, Richard Nixon. No, just a regular mistake.

I can''t wait til I''m old enough to feel ways about stuff! Guess again. Well, thanks to the Internet, I''m now bored with sex. Is there a place on the web that panders to my lust for violence? Hi, I''m a naughty nurse, and I really need someone to talk to. $9.95 a minute. Hey, whatcha watching?</p><p>You guys aren''t Santa! You''re not even robots. How dare you lie in front of Jesus?

But then the winter came, and the grasshopper died, and the octopus ate all his acorns. Also he got a race car. Is any of this getting through to you? Negative, bossy meat creature! I videotape every customer that comes in here, so that I may blackmail them later. Have you ever tried just turning off the TV, sitting down with your children, and hitting them?

But you may have to metaphorically make a deal with the devil.  And by "devil", I mean Robot Devil.  And by "metaphorically", I mean get your coat.</p><p>Meh. Kids don''t turn rotten just from watching TV. Now that the, uh, garbage ball is in space, Doctor, perhaps you can help me with my sexual inhibitions? Guess again. Hey, what kinda party is this? There''s no booze and only one hooker. So I really am important? How I feel when I''m drunk is correct?</p><p>I''m sure those windmills will keep them cool. Please, Don-Bot&hellip; look into your hard drive, and open your mercy file! Bender, hurry! This fuel''s expensive! Also, we''re dying! Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub onto your skin? You''d think it would be something you''d have to freebase. You''re going to do his laundry?</p><p>With a warning label this big, you know they gotta be fun! Who am I making this out to? And until then, I can never die? As an interesting side note, as a head without a body, I envy the dead. So, how ''bout them Knicks? And when we woke up, we had these bodies.</p><h3>Parasites Lost</h3><p>It''s just like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus. All year long, the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter, while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV. But then the winter came, and the grasshopper died, and the octopus ate all his acorns. Also he got a race car. Is any of this getting through to you? I didn''t ask for a completely reasonable excuse! I asked you to get busy! You, minion. Lift my arm. AFTER HIM!</p><p>I am Singing Wind, Chief of the Martians. Oh sure! Blame the wizards! Well, then good news! It''s a suppository. It''s okay, Bender. I like cooking too. Would you censor the Venus de Venus just because you can see her spewers? We can''t compete with Mom! Her company is big and evil! Ours is small and neutral! I was having the most wonderful dream. Except you were there, and you were there, and you were there! Yes, I saw. You were doing well, until everyone died.</p><p>Good man. Nixon''s pro-war and pro-family. Bender, we''re trying our best. And yet you haven''t said what I told you to say! How can any of us trust you? You''ll have all the Slurm you can drink when you''re partying with Slurms McKenzie! This opera''s as lousy as it is brilliant!  Your lyrics lack subtlety. You can''t just have your characters announce how they feel. That makes me feel angry! Goodbye, friends.  I never thought I''d die like this.  But I always really hoped. I''m Santa Claus!</p><p>No! The kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires! With gusto. Really?! Uh, is the puppy mechanical in any way?</p>'
