<h2><a name="H_1_1" title="Introduction"></a>Routino Introduction</h2>

Routino is an application for finding a route between two points using the
dataset of topographical information collected by
<a class="ext" title="OpenStreetMap" href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/">http://www.OpenStreetMap.org</a>.

<p>

Starting from the raw OpenStreetMap data (in the form of the '.osm' XML files
available on the internet) a custom database is generated that contains the
information useful for routing.  With this database and two points specified by
latitude and longitude an optimum route (either shortest or quickest) is
determined.  The route is calculated for OpenStreetMap highways (roads, paths
etc) using one of the common forms of transport defined in OpenStreetMap (foot,
bicycle, horse, motorcar, motorbike etc).

<p>

When processing the OpenStreetMap data the types of highways are recorded and
these set default limits on the types of traffic allowed.  More specific
information about permissions for different types of transport are also recorded
as are maximum speed limits.  Further restrictions like one-way streets, weight,
height, width and length limits are also included where specified. Additionally
a set of properties of each highway are also recorded.  The processing of the
input file is controlled by a configuration file which determines the
information that is used.

<p>

When calculating a route the type of transport to be used is taken into account
to ensure that the known restrictions are followed.  Each of the different
highway types can further be allowed or disallowed depending on preferences.
For each type of highway a default speed limit is defined (although the actual
speed used will be the lowest of the default and any specified in the original
data).  To make use of the information about restrictions the weight, height,
width and length of the transport can also be specified.  Further preferences
about road properties (e.g. paved or not) can also be selected.  The simplest
type of turn restrictions (those formed from an initial way, a node and a second
way) are also obeyed.

<p>

The result of calculating the route can be presented in several different ways.
An HTML file can be produced that contains a description of the route to take
with instructions for each of the important junctions.  The contents of the file
are created based on a set of translations specified in a configuration file.
The route is also available in a
<a class="ext" title="GPX format" href="http://www.topografix.com/gpx.asp">GPX (GPS eXchange) XML format</a>.
format file containing either every point and highway segment (a track file) or
just a waypoint and translated instructions for the important junctions (a route
file).
Additionally there are two plain text files that contain all data points or just
the important ones (intended for debugging and further processing).

<p>

One of the design aims of Routino was to make the software are flexible as
possible in selecting routing preferences but also have a sensible set of
default values.  Another design aim was that finding the optimum route should be
very fast and most of the speed increases come from the carefully chosen and
optimised data format.


<h2><a name="H_1_2"></a>Disclaimer</h2>

The route that is calculated by this software is only as good as the input data.

<p>

Routino comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY for the software itself or the route
that is calculated by it.


<h2><a name="H_1_3"></a>Demonstration</h2>

A live demonstration of the router for the UK is available on the internet:
<br>
<a title="Routino demo" href="http://www.routino.org/uk/">http://www.routino.org/uk/</a>

<p>

The source code download available below also includes a set of files that can
be used to create your own interactive map.

<p>

The interactive map is made possible by use of the OpenLayers Javascript
library from <a class="ext" href="http://www.openlayers.org" title="OpenLayers">http://www.openlayers.org/</a>.


<h2><a name="H_1_4"></a>Documentation</h2>

A full set of
<a href="index.html" title="Documentation">documentation</a>
is available that describes how to install and use the programs as well as
what should go in the configuration files and how it works.
