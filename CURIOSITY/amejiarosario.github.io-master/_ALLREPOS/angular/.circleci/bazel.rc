# These options are enabled when running on CI
# We do this by copying this file to /etc/bazel.bazelrc at the start of the build.
# See documentation in /docs/BAZEL.md

# Save downloaded repositories in a location that can be cached by CircleCI. This helps us
# speeding up the analysis time significantly with Bazel managed node dependencies on the CI.

# Don't be spammy in the logs
# TODO(gmagolan): Hide progress again once build performance improves
# Presently, CircleCI can timeout during bazel test ... with the following
# error: Too long with no output (exceeded 10m0s)
# build --noshow_progress

# Print all the options that apply to the build.
# This helps us diagnose which options override others
# (e.g. /etc/bazel.bazelrc vs. tools/bazel.rc)

# Workaround https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/3645
# Bazel doesn't calculate the memory ceiling correctly when running under Docker.
# Limit Bazel to consuming resources that fit in CircleCI "xlarge" class
