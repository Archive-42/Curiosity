= Dotfiles

Inspired on
- https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/Cheatsheet
- https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles
- https://github.com/holman/dotfiles
- https://dev.to/aspittel/set-up-my-computer-with-me-5bee

I prefered a fast terminal to a pretty one.
Before I had `oh-my-zsh`, `nvm`, `avm` and many plugins that make load time very slow.
No this time. :)

== Nice replacements

- OSX ships with an old version of Bash that does not support the \e escape character. Use \x1B or update Bash (`brew install bash`).
- change `less`/`more`/`cat` for `bat`[https://github.com/sharkdp/bat]

== TODO

- Replace NVM for https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf
- Use a Brewfile - https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-bundle
- Automatically push on commit: https://stackoverflow.com/a/7925891/684957

== Programming language version managers

Some version managers are very slow loading like:
- https://github.com/creationix/nvm
- https://github.com/tj/n

- https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf
