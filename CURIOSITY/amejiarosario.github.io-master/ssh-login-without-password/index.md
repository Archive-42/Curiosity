If you want to login to a remote server using SSH and don't have to type the password again and again, here is a little trick

<span id="more"></span>

$Â cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh &lt;user&gt;@&lt;server.domain&gt; 'cat &gt;&gt; .ssh/authorized_keys'

After you run this and enter your password (for the last time), you can login to your server just typing:

$ ssh &lt;user&gt;@&lt;server.domain&gt;

You are all set.
