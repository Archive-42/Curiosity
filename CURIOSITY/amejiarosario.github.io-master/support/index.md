This blog was created to keep track of how I solved technical. Over time, I noticed that traffic peeked around 100k page views per month. Since then I’m trying to create content that helps people learn about programming, algorithms, and getting started with web frameworks.

I also have a full-time job, but I’d like to allocate more time to this project, and with your help, this can be possible. Here are some ways how you can support this project.
