My coding **environments** (some dotfiles, and configs) and useful tools, and commands. 

I do almost all my work in cloud VPS, so these scripts help me get set up quickly and work in vim and git efficiently.

Also includes a script for counting lines of code using common tools.

Now includes a funding block in the NPM
