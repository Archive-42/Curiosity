# Append two more function calls to accomplish the following:
#
# 1. Use group_by() (from dplyr) to group the data by part and
# sex, in that order.
#
# 2. Use mutate to add two new columns, whose values will be
# automatically computed group-by-group:
#
#   * total = sum(count)
#   * prop = count / total
#
