- Class: text
  Output: "In modeling, our interest lies in parsimonious, interpretable representations of the data that enhance our understanding of the phenomena under study. Omitting variables results in bias in the coefficients of interest - unless their regressors are uncorrelated with the omitted ones. On the other hand, including any new variables increases (actual, not estimated) standard errors of other regressors. So we don't want to idly throw variables into the model. This lesson is about the second of these two issues, which is known as variance inflation."

- Class: text
  Output: "We shall use simulations to illustrate variance inflation. The source code for these simulations is in a file named vifSims.R which I have copied into your working directory and tried to display in your source code editor. If I've failed to display it, you should open it manually."

- Class: mult_question  
  Output: "Find the function, makelms, at the top of vifSims.R. The final expression in makelms creates 3 linear models. The first, lm(y ~ x1), predicts y in terms of x1, the second predicts y in terms of x1 and x2, the third in terms of all three regressors. The second coefficient of each model, for instance coef(lm(y ~ x1))[2], is extracted and returned in a 3-long vector. What does this second coefficient represent?"
  AnswerChoices: The coefficient of x1.; The coefficient of the intercept.; The coefficient of x2.
  CorrectAnswer: The coefficient of x1.
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal= 'The coefficient of x1.')
  Hint: "The first coefficient is that of the intercept. The rest are in the order given by the formula."

- Class: mult_question  
  Output: "In makelms, the simulated dependent variable, y, depends on which of the regressors?"
  AnswerChoices: x1;x1 and x2;x1, x2, and x3;
  CorrectAnswer: x1
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal= 'x1')
  Hint: The dependent variable, y, is formed by the expression, y <- x1 + rnorm(length(x1), sd = .3). Which of the regressors, x1, x2, x3, appears in this expression?

- Class: mult_question  
  Output: "In vifSims.R, find the functions, rgp1() and rgp2(). Both functions generate 3 regressors, x1, x2, and x3. Compare the lines following the comment Point A in rgp1() with those following Point C in rgp2(). Which of the following statements about x1, x2, and x3 is true?"
  AnswerChoices: x1, x2, and x3 are uncorrelated in rgp1(), but not in rgp2().;x1, x2, and x3 are correlated in rgp1(), but not in rgp2().;x1, x2, and x3 are uncorrelated in both rgp1() and rgp2().;x1, x2, and x3 are correlated in both rgp1() and rgp2().
  CorrectAnswer: x1, x2, and x3 are uncorrelated in rgp1(), but not in rgp2().
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal= 'x1, x2, and x3 are uncorrelated in rgp1(), but not in rgp2().')
  Hint: "In rgp2(), in the lines following Point C, x1 appears in the expressions which form x2 and x3. In rgp1(), in the lines following Point A, the regressors are formed by independent calls to rnorm(), which simulates independent, identically distributed samples from a normal distribution."

- Class: mult_question  
  Output: "In the line following Point B in rgp1(), the function maklms(x1, x2, x3) is applied 1000 times. Each time it is applied, it simulates a new dependent variable, y, and returns estimates of the coefficient of x1 for each of the 3 models, y ~ x1, y ~ x1 + x2, and y ~ x1 + x2 + x3. It thus computes 1000 estimates of the  3 coefficients, collecting the results in 3x1000 array, beta. In the next line, the expression, apply(betas, 1, var), does which of the following?"
  AnswerChoices: Computes the variance of each row.;Computes the variance of each column.
  CorrectAnswer: Computes the variance of each row.
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal= 'Computes the variance of each row.')
  Hint: "We hope to illustrate the effect of extra variables on the variance of x1's coefficient. For this purpose we have 3 models, y ~ x1, y ~ x1 + x2, and y ~ x1 + x2 + x3. The three rows of beta correspond to the three models. The columns correspond to the 1000 simulated situations in which we estimate the coefficients of x1 for each of the three models. We are interested in the variance of the x1 coefficient for each of those three models."

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "The function rgp1() computes the variance in estimates of the coefficient of x1 in each of the three models, y ~ x1, y ~ x1 + x2, and y ~ x1 + x2 + x3. (The results are rounded to 5 decimal places for convenient viewing.) This simulation approximates the variance (i.e., squared standard error) of x1's coefficient in each of these three models. Recall that variance inflation is due to correlated regressors and that in rgp1() the regressors are uncorrelated. Run the simulation rgp1() now. Be patient. It takes a while."
  CorrectAnswer: rgp1()
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='rgp1()')
  Hint: Just enter rgp1() at the R prompt.

- Class: mult_question  
  Output: "The variances in each of the three models are approximately equal, as expected, since the other regressors, x2 and x3, are uncorrelated with the regressor of interest, x1. However, in rgp2(), x2 and x3 both depend on x1, so we should expect an effect. From the expressions assigning x2 and x3 which follow Point C, which is more strongly correlated with x1?"
  AnswerChoices: x3;x2
  CorrectAnswer: x3
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal= 'x3')
  Hint: "In vifSims.R, look at the lines following Point C again, and note that 1/sqrt(2) in the expression for x2 is much smaller than 0.95 in the expression for x3."

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Run rgp2() to simulate standard errors in the coefficient of x1 for cases in which x1 is correlated with the other regressors"
  CorrectAnswer: rgp2()
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='rgp2()')
  Hint: Just enter rgp2() at the R prompt.

- Class: text
  Output: "In this case, variance inflation due to correlated regressors is clear, and is most pronounced in the third model, y ~ x1 + x2 + x3, since x3 is the regressor most strongly correlated with x1."

- Class: text
  Output: "In these two simulations we had 1000 samples of estimated coefficients, hence could calculate sample variance in order to illustrate the effect. In a real case, we have only one set of coefficients and we depend on theoretical estimates. However, theoretical estimates contain an unknown constant of proportionality. We therefore depend on ratios of theoretical estimates called Variance Inflation Factors, or VIFs."

- Class: text
  Output: "A variance inflation factor (VIF) is a ratio of estimated variances, the variance due to including the ith regressor, divided by that due to including a corresponding ideal regressor which is uncorrelated with the others. VIF's can be calculated directly, but the car package provides a convenient method for the purpose as we will illustrate using the Swiss data from the datasets package."

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "According to its documentation, the Swiss data set consists of a standardized fertility measure and socioeconomic indicators for each of 47 French-speaking provinces of Switzerland in about 1888 when Swiss fertility rates began to fall. Type head(swiss) or View(swiss) to examine the data."
  CorrectAnswer: head(swiss)
  AnswerTests: ANY_of_exprs('head(swiss)', 'View(swiss)')
  Hint: Enter either head(swiss) or View(swiss) at the R prompt.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Fertility was thought to depend on five socioeconomic factors: the percent of males working in Agriculture, the percent of draftees receiving the highest grade on the army's Examination, the percent of draftees with Education beyond primary school, the percent of the population which was Roman Catholic, and the rate of Infant Mortality in the province. Use linear regression to model Fertility in terms of these five regressors and an intercept. Store the model in a variable named mdl."
  CorrectAnswer: mdl <- lm(Fertility ~ ., swiss)
  AnswerTests: creates_lm_model('mdl <- lm(Fertility ~ ., swiss)')
  Hint: "Entering mdl <- lm(Fertility ~ ., swiss) is the easiest way to model Fertility as a function of all five regressors. The dot after the ~ means to include all (including an intercept.)"

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Calculate the VIF's for each of the regressors using vif(mdl)."
  CorrectAnswer: vif(mdl)
  AnswerTests: omnitest('vif(mdl)')
  Hint: "Just enter vif(mdl) at the R prompt."

- Class: text
  Output: "These VIF's show, for each regression coefficient, the variance inflation due to including all the others. For instance, the variance in the estimated coefficient of Education is 2.774943 times what it might have been if Education were not correlated with the other regressors. Since Education and score on an Examination are likely to be correlated, we might guess that most of the variance inflation for Education is due to including Examination."

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Make a second linear model of Fertility in which Examination is omitted, but the other four regressors are included. Store the result in a variable named mdl2."
  CorrectAnswer: mdl2 <- lm(Fertility ~ . -Examination, swiss)
  AnswerTests: creates_lm_model('mdl2 <- lm(Fertility ~ . -Examination, swiss)')
  Hint: "Entering mdl2 <- lm(Fertility ~ . -Examination, swiss) is the easiest way to model Fertility as a function of all the regressors except Examination. The dot after ~ means all, and the minus sign in front of Examination means except."

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Calculate the VIF's for this model using vif(mdl2)."
  CorrectAnswer: vif(mdl2)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='vif(mdl2)')
  Hint: Just enter vif(mdl2) at the R prompt.

- Class: text
  Output: "As expected, omitting Examination has markedly decreased the VIF for Education, from 2.774943 to 1.816361. Note that omitting Examination has had almost no effect the VIF for Infant Mortality. Chances are Examination and Infant Mortality are not strongly correlated. Now, before finishing this lesson, let's review several significant points."

- Class: mult_question  
  Output: "A VIF describes the increase in the variance of a coefficient due to the correlation of its regressor with the other regressors. What is the relationship of a VIF to the standard error of its coefficient?"
  AnswerChoices: "VIF is the square of standard error inflation.;They are the same.;There is no relationship."
  CorrectAnswer: VIF is the square of standard error inflation.
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal= 'VIF is the square of standard error inflation.')
  Hint: "Variance is the square of standard deviation, and standard error is the standard deviation of an estimated coefficient."

- Class: mult_question  
  Output: "If a regressor is strongly correlated with others, hence will increase their VIF's, why shouldn't we just exclude it?"
  AnswerChoices: "Excluding it might bias coefficient estimates of regressors with which it is correlated.;We should always exclude it.;We should never exclude anything."
  CorrectAnswer: Excluding it might bias coefficient estimates of regressors with which it is correlated.
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal= 'Excluding it might bias coefficient estimates of regressors with which it is correlated.')
  Hint: "Excluding a regressor can bias estimates of coefficients for correlated regressors."

- Class: mult_question  
  Output: "The problems of variance inflation and bias due to excluded regressors both involve correlated regressors. However there are methods, such as factor analysis or principal componenent analysis, which can convert regressors to an equivalent uncorrelated set. Why then, when modeling, should we not just use uncorrelated regressors and avoid all the trouble?"
  AnswerChoices: "Using converted regressors may make interpretation difficult.; Factor analysis takes too much computation.; We should always use uncorrelated regressors."
  CorrectAnswer: Using converted regressors may make interpretation difficult.
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal= 'Using converted regressors may make interpretation difficult.')
  Hint: "In modeling, our interest lies in parsimonious, interpretable representations of the data that enhance our understanding of the phenomena under study."

- Class: text
  Output: That completes the exercise in variance inflation. The issue of omitting regressors is discussed in another lesson.
