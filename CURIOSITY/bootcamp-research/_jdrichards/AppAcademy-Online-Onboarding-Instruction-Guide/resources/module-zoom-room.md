# Navigate to Zoom Room

In order to Navigate to a Cohort's Zoom Room you only need to follow a few steps.

1. Log in to Zoom using your App Academy credentials.
2. In your Browser, Navigate to the [Progress Tracker Site][progress-tracker-site].
3. In the upper left corner you can choose from any of the current online cohorts. The cohort choice will be based on Starting Month. (**NOTE: Where do they cross-reference the Module number to the starting Month?**)
