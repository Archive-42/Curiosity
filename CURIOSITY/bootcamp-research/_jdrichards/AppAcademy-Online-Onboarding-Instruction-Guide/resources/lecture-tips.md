# Lecture Tips

Here are tips that may help you when preparing:

1. If you are going to demo, look for the missing pieces between the readings, videos and the projects and fill in those pieces.
2. Visual diagrams and images are a great tool for Visual Learners
3. Practice teaching on your Zoom account and record yourself to see how well you coordinate with the tools and sharing your screen etc.
4. If you are using web tools, practice using them while you record to make sure that your execution is seamless.
5. When teaching a new concept, it can be useful watch some youtube videos of other folks introducing that same content. It helps to get some context on how other folks explain/describe things and to make sure that key points aren't missed that might be useful/interesting to students.
6. Think about the flow of what you are telling students. Students often retain info better if it builds on itself in a way they can follow. If you can work on the same example and keep adding to it students have to do less mental work to follow along.
7. Some people like to write out everything. Obviously time is a constraint, but some instructors find it useful to type out every single word they plan to tell students. It helps to have that reference if you get stuck, lost, or blank out during lecture. It also helps to have done a walk through super thoroughly of what you want to cover in lecture so you know the ordering and how long it might take to get through some content. You can also use this opportunity to make sure your explanations are clear, linear, and use the correct terminology.
8. Having Code that they can code along with whenever possible is a great tool.
9. Always try to anticipate questions on the topic. You could possibly write out what you think a common question might be, or check online for some common questions around a topic, you can also google “most confusing part of **\_**” to see what you find. When prepping answers for some of those q’s - Look for external resources and specific parts of the docs to send students to reference.
10. Try and break your code demos as much as you can. Not only does it help the student learn, it also can alleviate unneeded pressure should you need to live debug your own lecture.
11. Try to learn something cool about the topic. Something you didn’t know before to get you invested and feel like you are also growing. This could be something (ideally) you can show students who are interested in learning just a little bit more about the topic.
12. Don’t be afraid to push off answering a question until later. If you need to set expectations before answering questions do it! “I’ll take 5 questions on some topic before we move on”
13. Always acknowledge when you don’t know something and show(or tell if tight on time) the students how to go about finding the answer to that question. “I’d likely search around MDN for if .sort mutates the string or not, and then if i couldn’t find it there I would test it out on an array and see if the array is changed after” etc.
14. EVERY SINGLE QUESTION IS A GOOD QUESTION. Focus on how you respond/react/receive the question.Be aware of your facial expressions and tone. Treating every question as valid and important through your reaction and response goes a long way to making the cohort feel open and feel as if they are in a space for learning.
