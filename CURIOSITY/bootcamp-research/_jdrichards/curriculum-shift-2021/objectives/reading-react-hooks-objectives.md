* Use the `useEffect` hook to trigger an operation as a result of a _side
  effect_.
* Initialize and update state within a function component.
* Describe the three ways in which a re-render can be triggered for a React
  component.
* Optimize your application's performance by using `useCallback` and `useRef`.
* Use debugging tools to understand and resolve issues with re-renders
