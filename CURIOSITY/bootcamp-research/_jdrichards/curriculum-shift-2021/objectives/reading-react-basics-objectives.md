# React Basics Objectives

React is a powerful, modern front-end framework primarily used to create
single-page applications.  Not only will learning this framework give you a
marketable skill, it will also serve as a foundation for you to learn other
front-end frameworks, such as Angular, or Vue, on your own.

After completing this material, you will be able to:

* Explain how React uses a tree data structure called the virtual DOM to model
  the DOM
* Create virtual DOM nodes using JSX
* Describe how JSX transforms into actual DOM nodes
* Use the `ReactDOM.render` method to have React render your virtual DOM nodes
  under an actual DOM node
* Attach an event listener to an actual DOM node using a virtual node
* Use `create-react-app` to stand up a new React application and import needed assets
* Construct a custom 'create-react-app' template and use it to start a new application
