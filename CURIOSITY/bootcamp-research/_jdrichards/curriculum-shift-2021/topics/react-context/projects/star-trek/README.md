# Star Trek Project

In this project, you will make enhancements to an online trading card 
application. This application allows a user to select cards to build a deck for
game play or trading in the future.

The original developers set up the navigation (using `react-router-dom`) and
created the two primary screen layouts (using function components). Now, they 
need your help with capturing, storing and displaying the user's selection in 
their deck.

Begin by downloading the [starter project]. Then follow the instructions 
provided in the enclosed _README.md_.

> Tip: You will want to include this one into your GitHub collection, so make 
> sure you set up an appropriate repo for it as you begin.
