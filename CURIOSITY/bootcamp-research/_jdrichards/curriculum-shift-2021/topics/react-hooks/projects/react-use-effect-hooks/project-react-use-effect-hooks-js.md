# Practice `useEffect` Hook

The goal of this project is to practice different use cases for `useEffect` in 
*React* to improve your understanding and build confidence in your skills.

* Debugging prop changes
* Debugging state changes
* Catching state changes to generate another state value programmatically
* Catching prop changes to generate a state value programmatically

You are being provided with a [starter project] so you can focus on `useEffect`.
Detailed instructions are in the README with the project.

**Please move on to the next project after one hour.**

## To Begin

Download the [starter project] as a zip file.

Create a new repo in *GitHub*, and clone it to your local machine.
(See [Git Reference] for a refresher on the commands.)

Unzip the starter into the new (cloned) folder.

Using command line, `cd` to that folder, then `commit` the base version to 
*git* and `push` it up to *GitHub*.

Install the packages (`npm install`) and run the application (`npm start`).

Look around to see what's built for you. When you are ready, complete the 
4 phases in the _README.md_ file provided in the [starter project]. Detailed 
steps and sample code are provided to help you.

The more your do on your own, the better you will learn *React*. Challenge
yourself as you see fit. Two bonus phases are included if you'd like additional
practice in *React* (both `useEffect` other features).

Good luck! Have fun!

**Make sure to move on to the next project after one hour.**
