Hi! My name is Joanna and today I'll be teaching you about how to refactor a
project from class components to function components

that make use of React Hooks!

We'll focus on using the three basic hooks referenced in the Hooks API docs.

- First, you'll use the `useState` hook to set and update a slice of state.
- Second, you'll use the `useEffect` hook to make an asynchronous fetch call to
  the Giphy API.
- And third, you'll use the `useContext` hook to reference and update a context
  object.
