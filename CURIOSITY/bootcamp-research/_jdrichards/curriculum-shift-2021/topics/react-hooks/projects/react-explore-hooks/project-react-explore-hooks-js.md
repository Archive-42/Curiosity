# Explore React Hooks

In this project, you will get your first experience with the hooks. This will 
require you to add state variables to React components (`useState`), as well as,
capture and respond to state changes with effects (`useEffect`). A starter 
project has been provided, so you can stay focused on these new skills.

## Getting started

* Clone the starter project from
  https://github.com/appacademy-starters/react-explore-hooks
* Run `npm install` to install the packages
* Run `npm start` to run the application on port 3000

Now, follow the steps in the _README.md_.
