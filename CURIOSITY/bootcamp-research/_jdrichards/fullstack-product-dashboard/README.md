# Product Dashboard with Thunk

Here is a No Thunk Product Dashboard project with instructions and some tests

It allows the programmer to build a complete project using Postgres, Express, Redux and React and gives them an opportunity to build out a full data flow with full CRUD on the backend and `GET` and `PUT` on the frontend with the opportunity to build `UPDATE` and `DELETE` on the frontend on their own as a bonus.

Backend instructions and code are based on the Mod 4 -> Week 12 -> Wednesday -> API Project
