## When to shard

Before you dive into this section, please note that sharding may not be necessary for you. Sharding is only necessary at 2,500 guildsâ€”at that point, Discord will not allow your bot to login without sharding. With that in mind, you should consider this when your bot is around 2,000 guilds, which should be enough time to get this working. Contrary to popular belief, sharding itself is very simple. It can be complex depending on your bot's needs, however. If your bot is in a total of 2,000 or more servers, then please continue with this guide. Otherwise, it may be a good idea to wait until then.

## How does sharding work?

As an application grows large, developers may find it necessary to split their process up to run parallel to one another in order to maximize efficiency. In a much larger scale of things, the developer might notice their process slow down, amongst other problems.
[Check out the official Discord documentation on the topic.](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/gateway#sharding)

:::warning
This guide only explains the basics of sharding using the built-in ShardingManager, which can run shards as separate processes or threads on a single machine. If you need to scale beyond that (e.g. running shards on multiple machines/containers), you can still do it with discord.js by passing appropriate options to the Client constructor, but you will be on your own regarding managing shards and passing information between them.
:::

## Sharding file

First, you'll need to have a file that you'll be launching from now on, rather than your original `index.js` file. It's highly recommended renaming that to `bot.js` and naming this new file to `index.js` instead. Copy & paste the following snippet into your new `index.js` file.

<branch version="11.x">

```js
const { ShardingManager } = require('discord.js');
const manager = new ShardingManager('./bot.js', { token: 'your-token-goes-here' });

manager.on('launch', shard => console.log(`Launched shard ${shard.id}`));
manager.spawn();
```

</branch>
<branch version="12.x">

```js
const { ShardingManager } = require('discord.js');
const manager = new ShardingManager('./bot.js', { token: 'your-token-goes-here' });

manager.on('shardCreate', shard => console.log(`Launched shard ${shard.id}`));
manager.spawn();
```

</branch>

The above code utilizes the discord.js sharding manager to spawn the recommended amount of shards for your bot. The recommended amount should be approximately 1,000 guilds per shard. Note that you have to attach the event listener to `shardCreate` before calling `.spawn()` to prevent a race condition possibly preventing shard 0 from logging the successful launch. Even though you provide the token here, you will still need to send it over to the main bot file in `client.login()`, so don't forget to do that.

::: tip
You can find the methods available for the ShardingManager class <branch version="11.x" inline>[here](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/v11/class/ShardingManager)</branch><branch version="12.x" inline>[here](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/class/ShardingManager)</branch>. Though, you may not be making much use of this section, unlike the next feature we will explore, which you may learn about by clicking [this link](/sharding/additional-information.md).
:::

## Getting started

You will most likely have to change some code in order to get your newly sharded bot to work. If your bot is very basic, then you're in luck! We assume you probably have some form of a `stats` command, by which you can quickly view your bots statistics, such as its server count. We will use it as an example that needs to be adapted to running with shards.

In this code, you likely have the snippet <branch version="11.x" inline>`client.guilds.size`</branch><branch version="12.x" inline>`client.guilds.cache.size`</branch>, which counts the number of *cached* guilds attached to that client. With sharding, since multiple processes will be launched, each process (each shard) will now have its own subset collection of guilds it is responsible for. This means that your original code will not function as you expect it to.

Here is some sample code for a `stats` command, without sharding taken into consideration:

<branch version="11.x">

```js
// bot.js
const { Client } = require('discord.js');
const client = new Client();
const prefix = '!';

client.on('message', message => {
	if (!message.content.startsWith(prefix) || message.author.bot) return;

	const args = message.content.slice(prefix.length).trim().split(/ +/);
	const command = args.shift().toLowerCase();

	if (command === 'stats') {
		return message.channel.send(`Server count: ${client.guilds.size}`);
	}
});

client.login('your-token-goes-here');
```

</branch>
<branch version="12.x">

```js
// bot.js
const { Client } = require('discord.js');
const client = new Client();
const prefix = '!';

client.on('message', message => {
	if (!message.content.startsWith(prefix) || message.author.bot) return;

	const args = message.content.slice(prefix.length).trim().split(/ +/);
	const command = args.shift().toLowerCase();

	if (command === 'stats') {
		return message.channel.send(`Server count: ${client.guilds.cache.size}`);
	}
});

client.login('your-token-goes-here');
```

</branch>

Let's say your bot is in a total of 3,600 guilds. Using the recommended shard count you might end up at 4 shards, each containing approximately 900 guilds. If a guild is on a certain shard (shard #2, for example) and it receives this command, the guild count will be close to 900, which is obviously not the "correct" number of guilds for your bot. "How can I fix this?", you ask? Well, that's why we're here, isn't it?

## FetchClientValues

First, let's take a look at <branch version="11.x" inline>[one of the most common sharding utility methods you'll be using](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/v11/class/ShardClientUtil?scrollTo=fetchClientValues)</branch><branch version="12.x" inline>[one of the most common sharding utility methods you'll be using](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/class/ShardClientUtil?scrollTo=fetchClientValues)</branch> called `fetchClientValues`. This method retrieves a property on the Client object of all shards.

Now, take the following snippet of code:

<branch version="11.x">

```js
client.shard.fetchClientValues('guilds.size').then(console.log);
```

</branch>
<branch version="12.x">

```js
client.shard.fetchClientValues('guilds.cache.size').then(console.log);
```

</branch>

If you run it, you will notice an output like `[898, 901, 900, 901]`. You will be correct in assuming that that's the total number of guilds per shard, which is stored in an array in the Promise. This probably isn't the ideal output for guild count, so we will need to make use of an array manipulation method, specifically [Array.reduce()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Reduce).

::: tip
It's highly recommended for you to visit [the documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Reduce) to understand how the `reduce()` method works, as you will probably find great use of it in sharding.
:::

In this case, this method iterates through the array and adds each current value to the total amount:

<branch version="11.x">

```js
client.shard.fetchClientValues('guilds.size')
	.then(results => {
		console.log(`${results.reduce((acc, guildCount) => acc + guildCount, 0)} total guilds`);
	})
	.catch(console.error);
```

</branch>
<branch version="12.x">

```js
client.shard.fetchClientValues('guilds.cache.size')
	.then(results => {
		console.log(`${results.reduce((acc, guildCount) => acc + guildCount, 0)} total guilds`);
	})
	.catch(console.error);
```

</branch>

While it's a bit unattractive to have more nesting in your commands, it is necessary when not using `async`/`await`. Now, the code at the top should look something like the below:

<branch version="11.x">

```diff
	if (command === 'stats') {
-		return message.channel.send(`Server count: ${client.guilds.size}`);
+		return client.shard.fetchClientValues('guilds.size')
+			.then(results => {
+				return message.channel.send(`Server count: ${results.reduce((acc, guildCount) => acc + guildCount, 0)}`);
+			})
+			.catch(console.error);
	}
```

</branch>
<branch version="12.x">

```diff
	if (command === 'stats') {
-		return message.channel.send(`Server count: ${client.guilds.cache.size}`);
+		return client.shard.fetchClientValues('guilds.cache.size')
+			.then(results => {
+				return message.channel.send(`Server count: ${results.reduce((acc, guildCount) => acc + guildCount, 0)}`);
+			})
+			.catch(console.error);
	}
```

</branch>

## BroadcastEval

Next, check out <branch version="11.x" inline>[another handy sharding method](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/v11/class/ShardClientUtil?scrollTo=broadcastEval)</branch><branch version="12.x" inline>[another handy sharding method](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/class/ShardClientUtil?scrollTo=broadcastEval)</branch> known as `broadcastEval`. This method makes all of the shards evaluate a given script, where `this` is the `client` once each shard gets to evaluating it. You can read more about the `this` keyword [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this). For now, essentially understand that it is the shard's Client object.

<branch version="11.x">

```js
client.shard.broadcastEval('this.guilds.reduce((acc, guild) => acc + guild.memberCount, 0)').then(console.log);
```

</branch>
<branch version="12.x">

```js
client.shard.broadcastEval('this.guilds.cache.reduce((acc, guild) => acc + guild.memberCount, 0)').then(console.log);
```

</branch>

This will run the code given to `broadcastEval` on each shard and return the results to the Promise as an array, once again. You should see something like `[9001, 16658, 13337, 15687]` logged. The code being sent to each shard adds up the `memberCount` property of every guild that shard is handling and returns it, so it's each shard's total guild member count. Of course, if you want to then total up the member count of *every* shard, you can do the same thing again on the results returned from the Promise.

<branch version="11.x">

```js
client.shard.broadcastEval('this.guilds.reduce((acc, guild) => acc + guild.memberCount, 0)')
	.then(results => {
		return message.channel.send(`Total member count: ${results.reduce((acc, memberCount) => acc + memberCount, 0)}`);
	})
	.catch(console.error);
```

</branch>
<branch version="12.x">

```js
client.shard.broadcastEval('this.guilds.cache.reduce((acc, guild) => acc + guild.memberCount, 0)')
	.then(results => {
		return message.channel.send(`Total member count: ${results.reduce((acc, memberCount) => acc + memberCount, 0)}`);
	})
	.catch(console.error);
```

</branch>

## Putting them together

You'd likely want to output both pieces of information in the stats command, so let's combine these two examples using [Promise.all()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/all):

<branch version="11.x">

```js
const promises = [
	client.shard.fetchClientValues('guilds.size'),
	client.shard.broadcastEval('this.guilds.reduce((acc, guild) => acc + guild.memberCount, 0)'),
];

Promise.all(promises)
	.then(results => {
		const totalGuilds = results[0].reduce((acc, guildCount) => acc + guildCount, 0);
		const totalMembers = results[1].reduce((acc, memberCount) => acc + memberCount, 0);
		return message.channel.send(`Server count: ${totalGuilds}\nMember count: ${totalMembers}`);
	})
	.catch(console.error);
```

</branch>
<branch version="12.x">

```js
const promises = [
	client.shard.fetchClientValues('guilds.cache.size'),
	client.shard.broadcastEval('this.guilds.cache.reduce((acc, guild) => acc + guild.memberCount, 0)'),
];

Promise.all(promises)
	.then(results => {
		const totalGuilds = results[0].reduce((acc, guildCount) => acc + guildCount, 0);
		const totalMembers = results[1].reduce((acc, memberCount) => acc + memberCount, 0);
		return message.channel.send(`Server count: ${totalGuilds}\nMember count: ${totalMembers}`);
	})
	.catch(console.error);
```

</branch>

`Promise.all()` runs every promise you pass to it inside of an array in parallel, and waits for them all to finish before returning all of their results at once. The result is an array that corresponds with the array of promises you pass - so the first result element will be from the first promise. With that, your stats command should look something like this:

<branch version="11.x">

```diff
	if (command === 'stats') {
-		return message.channel.send(`Server count: ${client.guilds.size}`);
+		const promises = [
+			client.shard.fetchClientValues('guilds.size'),
+			client.shard.broadcastEval('this.guilds.reduce((acc, guild) => acc + guild.memberCount, 0)'')
+		];
+
+		return Promise.all(promises)
+			.then(results => {
+				const totalGuilds = results[0].reduce((acc, guildCount) => acc + guildCount, 0);
+				const totalMembers = results[1].reduce((acc, memberCount) => acc + memberCount, 0);
+				return message.channel.send(`Server count: ${totalGuilds}\nMember count: ${totalMembers}`);
+			})
+			.catch(console.error);
	}
```

</branch>
<branch version="12.x">

```diff
	if (command === 'stats') {
-		return message.channel.send(`Server count: ${client.guilds.cache.size}`);
+		const promises = [
+			client.shard.fetchClientValues('guilds.cache.size'),
+			client.shard.broadcastEval('this.guilds.cache.reduce((acc, guild) => acc + guild.memberCount, 0)'')
+		];
+
+		return Promise.all(promises)
+			.then(results => {
+				const totalGuilds = results[0].reduce((acc, guildCount) => acc + guildCount, 0);
+				const totalMembers = results[1].reduce((acc, memberCount) => acc + memberCount, 0);
+				return message.channel.send(`Server count: ${totalGuilds}\nMember count: ${totalMembers}`);
+			})
+			.catch(console.error);
	}
```
