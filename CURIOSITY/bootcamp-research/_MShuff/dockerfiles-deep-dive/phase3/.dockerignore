# for all code you usually don't want .git history in image, just the current commit you have checked out

# you usually don't want dockerfile and compose files in the image either

# for Node.js apps, you want to build the node_modules in the image, and not copy from host

# for Node.js app, you don't want to copy in files that are built on the local machine
