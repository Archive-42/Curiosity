# **Portfolio Sites**

Take 25 minutes to choose a template, download it, rename it githubusername.github.io , git init, and push it to a github repo of the same name:

## **Template Sources**

- [**Free CSS Templates**](http://www.free-css.com/template-categories/portfolio)
- [**HTML5 UP**](http://html5up.net/)
- [**Start Bootstrap**](http://startbootstrap.com/)
- [**Theme Wagon**](https://themewagon.com/top-html-landing-page-templates/)
- [**Templatemo**](https://templatemo.com/tag/portfolio)
- [**One Page Love**](https://onepagelove.com/templates/free-templates)

1. Once youâ€™ve decided on a template, download it to your machine.
2. Rename the folder `{$yourGitHubUserName}.github.io`, (e.g. if my GitHub
   username were QueenOfTheBeyhive, I would name my repo
   `QueenOfTheBeyhive.github.io`). This will be important for deployment to GitHub
   pages later.
3. Make sure to `git init` and set up your remote repository.
4. As always, make sure to read through any provided README for any potentially
   useful information.
5. Take some time to explore the structure, included elements, and default assets
   included in the template. Take special note of style sheets and the main HTML
   file. The main HTML must be called `index.html` and it must be located in the root
   of the directory. If the file is located elsewhere, relocate it to the root and adjust
   any relative paths for any imported scripts or style sheets.

# **QA Questions**

**10:22:12 From Alexis Kozak to Everyone : Scenario 1**

- It's 7:00 pm on a Friday, and you receive a message from Dev Ops that they haven't been able to upgrade a live Production environment as planned. There were feature updates in this release that customers have planned marketing campaigns around. It also included a bug fix for one customer thatâ€™s currently having to maintain a very manual workaround. What do you do?

**10:24:40 From Alexis Kozak to Everyone : Scenario 2**

- An application has been configured to send an email every time a patient requests a changed email. The automated email sends something to the old email, acknowledging that they changed their email, and if that isnâ€™t right, to please contact Secular Health Network. When you come into the office one morning, you see that thousands of emails have been generated in the space of two hours. What do you do? How do you find the number of emails sent?

**10:28:11 From Alexis Kozak to Everyone : Scenario 3**

- A customer has requested a change to SSO logic such that only users from a certain region can access SmartExam. Youâ€™ve implemented the rule on their demo environments and given them a testing plan that is simple and straightforward. During testing, youâ€™re included in multiple email chains with different parties, as well as some one-off calls and texts messages. Resources seem scattered, but the testing happens. After receiving confirmation from the customer that testing was successful, youâ€™re told the code is good to go into production. However, upon doing some quick checks, you discover that the rule you wrote doesnâ€™t work and would actually prevent any user from logging into SmartExam. The fix is quite simple. What do you do?
