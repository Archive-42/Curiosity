# Developer Console and Tools

- Code is prone to errors. In the browser, users don't see the errors by default.
- To see errors and get a lot of other useful information about scripts, **"developer tools"** have been embedded into browsers
- Most developers lean toward _Chrome_ and _Firefox_ for development because these browsers have the best developer tools. Other browsers also have developer tools and special features, but tend to be playing catch-up with Chrome and Firefox
  - Developers tend to pick a "favorite" browser, and then check the others to make sure their site runs well on other browsers

## <a href="https://google.com/chrome">**Google Chrome**</a>

- Open with `F12`, or if you're on Mac, `Cmd+Opt+J` to open the developer tools
- Will open on the _**Console Tab**_ by default
  - There will be a blue `>` symbol in the console. This is the command line, where can we type JS commands and execute them by pressing `Enter`
    - When we put a line of code into the console and press `Enter`, it usually executes. For multi-line input, press `Shift+Enter`, allowing you to enter long fragments of JS code
  - **Errors** will be colored red with a pinkish background, and will contain a clickable link to the source where the error occured along with the line number it occured on

## **<a href="https://www.mozilla.com/firefox">Firefox</a>, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge">Edge</a>, etc...**

- Most other browsers also open the developer tools with `F12`
- The look and feel should be similar, with mild adjustments

## <a href="https://www.apple.com/safari/">**Safari**</a>

- Safari is a Mac browser not supported by Windows/Linux and acts a little bit differently than the other browsers in that we must **Enable Developer Menu** first
  - Open _Preferences_ and go to the _Advanced_ pane. There will be a checkbox at the bottom that says: _Show Develop Menu in menu bar_
- `Cmd+Opt+C` can toggle the console.
