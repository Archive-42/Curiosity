- Created to make web pages interactive
- Programs are called _scripts_
  - Can be written in a web page's _HTML_ (HyperText Markup Language)
    - Inline or in an External file and linked
  - Provided and executed as plain text. Don't need any special compilation or preparation.
    - JavaScript is actually semi-compiled now with JIT (Just In Time)
- Despite the name, _JavaScript (JS)_ is very different from _Java_, which is a compiled language
- Was initially called **LiveScript**, but changed it's nice to piggyback off of Java's popularity at the time
- Has it's own specification called **ECMAScript**

## JavaScript Engines

- Can execute in the **browser (client-side)**, the **backend (server-side)**, or anywhere that has a special program called a **JavaScript Engine**
  - The browser has an embedded engine sometimes called a _JavaScript Virtual Machine_. Different engines have different codenames:
    - **V8** - Chome/Opera/Node/Edge
    - **SpiderMonkey** - Firefox
    - **Chakra** - Internet Explorer
    - **Nitro/SquirrelFish** - Safari
- ### **How Do Engines Work?**
  - The engine (embedded if in browser), reads (_parses_) the script
  - Converts (_compiles_) script to machine language
  - Machine code runs, quite fast
  - The engine applies optimizations at each step of the process
  - Watches the compiled script as it runs, analyzes the data that flows through it, and further optimized the machine code language based on this knowledge

## What Can In-Browser JavaScript Do?

- Modern JS is a "safe" programming language. It does not provide low-level access to CPU memory, because it was created for browsers which do not need it
- JavaScripts capabilities vary greatly depending on where it is used, such as in the browser vs. in Node
- In-browser JS can do everything related to webpage manipulation, interaction with the user, and the webserver, such as:
  - Add new HTML to the page, change existing content, and modify styles
  - React to user actions, run on mouse clicks, pointer movements, key presses
  - Send requests over the network to remote servers, download/upload files (**AJAX**/**COMET** technologies)
  - Get and set cookies, ask questions to user, display messages
  - Remember the data on the client-side with the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Storage_API">**Web Storage API**</a>

## What Can't In-Browser JavaScript Do?

- JS abilities in the browser are limited for the sake of the user's safety. We don't want evil websites accessing private information or manipulating a user's data
- Restrictions Include:
  - May not read/write files arbitrarily on the hard disk, copy them, or access programs. It has no direct access to OS functions
    - Modern browsers allow it to work with files, but the access is limited and only privded if the user does certain actions, like dropping a file into a browser window or selection it via an `<input>` tag.
    - There are ways to interact with the camera/microphone/other devices with the user's explicit permission. A JS enabled page may not sneakily enable a webcam, observe the surroundings, or send information to the NSA
  - Different tabs/windows generally do not know about each other. Sometimes they do, like when one window uses JS to open another. Even in this case, JS from one page my not access the other if they come from different sites (from a different _domain_, _protocol_, or _port_)
    - This is called the **"Same Origin Policy"**. To work around that, _both pages_ must agree for data exchange and contain a special JS code that handles it.
    - The limitation is for the user's safety. You don't want JS from one site being able to look into your GMail tab, for instance.
  - JS can easily communicate over the net to the server where the current page came from, but it's ability to receive data from other sites/domains is crippled. Though possible, it requires explicit agreement (expressed in _HTTP Headers_) from the remote side.
  - <img src="./../../images/part-1-intro-to-js-01.png" alt="JS capabilities example">
- These limits do not exist if JS is used outside of the browser, like on a server
- _Browser Extensions_ may also allow for extended JS permissions

## What Makes JavaScript Unique?

- JS is the only browser technology to combine:
  - Full Integration with _HTML/CSS_
  - Simple things done simply
  - Support by all major browsers enabled by default
- Beyond this, JS also allows us to create servers, single page apps, mobile apps, and much more...

## Languages Over JavaScript

- The syntax of JS does not suit everyone's needs. This is to be expected because projects and requirements differ among people and companies.
- This has caused new languages to appear, which are _transpiled_ (converted) to JS before they run in the browser
  - Modern tools make transpilation fast and transparent, allowing developers to code in another language and auto-convert it "under the hood"
- **Examples:**
  - <a href="http://coffeescript.org/">**CoffeeScript**</a> - Shorter syntax for clearer, concise code. Ruby devs love this
  - <a href="http://www.typescriptlang.org/">**TypeScript**</a> - _Strict Data Typing_ to simplify development and support complex systems. - **Microsoft**
  - <a href="http://flow.org/">**Flow**</a> - Also adds _Data Typing_ in a different way. - **Facebook**
  - <a href="https://www.dartlang.org/">**Dart**</a> - Standalone language that has it's own engine that runs in non-browser environments (like mobile apps), but can also be transpiled into JS. - **Google**
  - <a href="https://brython.info/">**Brython**</a> - **Python** transpiler to JS that enables the writing of applications in pure Python without JS
  - <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/js-overview.html">**Kotlin**</a> - Modern, concise, and safe programming language that can target the browser and Node
