# **Variables** - [Code](./2.4-variables.js)

- Often times, we will need to store data and access it later
  - Online shop - Items being sold, shopping cart, ...
  - Chat App - Users, messages, ...
- A "variable" is a named storage for data.
- We can create variables in three different ways:
  - `let` - Function scoped, re-assignable
    ```javascript
    let age; // Declaration and Initialization
    age = 33; // Assignment
    age = 24; // Re-assignable
    ```
  - `const` - Function scoped, not re-assignable
    ```javascript
    const pi = 3.14; // Not reassignable and must be given assignment upon declarataion and initialization
    ```
  - `var` - Block scoped, re-assignable. Considered _depracated_
    - <a href="https://javascript.info/var">Learn More About Var!</a>
- A _variable declaration_ is the creation of a new variable
  - `let name;`
  - Declaring a variable twice will trigger an error
- We use `=` to give the variable a value through _assignment_
  - `name = "Michael";`
- _Initialization_ refers to memory in the computer being allocated for a variable, and this happens automatically upon declaration.
- You can declare and assign multiple variables on a single line, although it is not recommended:
  ```javascript
  let firstName = 'Michael',
  	lastName = 'Shuff';
  ```
- Variables are **case-sensitive**!

## **Real Life Analogy**

- Imagine a variable as a box for data, with a unique sticker or marker label on it.
- We can put any value in our box
- We can replace what is in our box at any time
  - Unless it's a `const`
  - When the value is changed, the old data is removed from the variable
- We can also copy data from one variable into another
  ```javascript
  let mike = 'Michael';
  let firstName;
  firstName = mike;
  ```

## **Variable Naming**

- There are two limitations when naming a variable:

  - The name must contain only \_letters, digits, or $ and \_\_
    ```javascript
    let $ = 12;
    let _ = 'What?';
    ```
  - The first character must _NOT_ be a digit
    ```javascript
    let firstName; // Referred to as Camel Case
    let test123;
    ```
  - Variables are **case-sensitive**
  - Non-Latin letters are allowed, but not recommended
    ```javascript
    let имя = '...';
    let 我 = '...';
    ```
  - There is a list of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Lexical_grammar#Keywords">reserved keywords</a> which can't be used as variable names because they're used by JS itself
    ```javascript
    let let = 5; // SyntaxError
    let const = 10; // Also a SyntaxError
    ```
  - Global assignment without `use strict`
    - If you don't define a variable before assigning it a value (not using `let`, `const`, or `var`), it will be created in the global scope. This is **Not Recommended**
    - If we are using `"use strict";`, we will get an error to prevent us from doing this.

## **Constants**

- A **constant** is an unchanging variable declared with `const`. They can not be reassigned
  ```javascript
  const name = 'Michael';
  name = 'Joe'; // Error
  ```
- A good convention to use is to use `const` until you realize you need to change the variable possibly, then change it to `let`. Better safe than sorry and accidentally changing something we shouldn't.

### **UpperCase Constants**

- There is a widespread practice to use constant as aliases for difficult to remember values that are known prior to execution.
  - These constants are named using **capital letters** and **underscores**
    ```javascript
    const COLOR_RED = '#F00';
    const COLOR_GREEN = '#0F0';
    const COLOR_BLUE = '#00F';
    const COLOR_ORANGE = '#FF7F00';
    // picking a color...
    let color = COLOR_ORANGE;
    ```
  - Benefits to this:
    - These variable names are much easier to read than their value
    - They are much easier to type than their value
    - The names are more descriptive than the value
  - Capital letter constants are only for variables that are **values that never change and are known prior to execution!**

## **Name Things Right!**

- Variable names should have clean, obvious meaning
- When we return to code or someone else modifies or uses our code, if we don't have clean variable names, we won't know or remember what they're for
- **General Rules:**
  - Use human-readable names like `userName` or `shoppingCart`
  - Stay away from abbreviations or short names like `a`, `b`, and `c`
  - Make names maximally descriptive and concise. It is better to have longer, more descriptive variable names than repetitive, unclear names
  - Agree on terms within your team and in your own mind
