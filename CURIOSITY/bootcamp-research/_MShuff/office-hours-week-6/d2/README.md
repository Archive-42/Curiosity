# Promises Learning Objectives (Day 1)

- A **Promise** is an proxy for a value which is not known yet, and may or may not be known at a future point in time.  It is used to assist us in handling complex tasks *asynchronously* in the background.
- A **Promise** is in one of these states:
  - *pending*: initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.
  - *fulfilled*: meaning that the operation was completed successfully.
  - *rejected*: meaning that the operation failed.

## Instantiate a Promise object

[Code](./promise-01.js)

## Use Promises to write more maintainable asynchronous code

[Code](./promise-02.js)

## Use the fetch API to make Promise-based API calls

[Code](./promise-03.js)
