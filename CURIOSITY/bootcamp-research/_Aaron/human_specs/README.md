## About Human Specs

[https://human-spec.herokuapp.com/ ](https://human-spec.herokuapp.com/)

</div>

Human Specs was inspired by human benchmark, a testing application much like this one.
Human Specs design is attributed to MonkeyType and thier clean, minimalistic, shared styling across the board.
Human Specs' Design was chosen to allow for minimal distraction to improve concentration to allow for a more valid test.
Human Specs allows individuals to explore thier strengths and weaknesses and train to improve them.
