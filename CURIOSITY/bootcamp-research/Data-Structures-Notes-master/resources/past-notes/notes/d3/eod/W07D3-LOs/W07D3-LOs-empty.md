## Sorting Algorithms (W7D3) - Learning Objectives

### Sorting Algorithms
1. Explain the complexity of and write a function that performs bubble sort on an array of numbers.
- Time Complexity: O(__)
- Space Complexity: O(__)
- Code:
```javascript
function bubbleSort(array) {

}
```

2. Explain the complexity of and write a function that performs selection sort on an array of numbers.
- Time Complexity: O(__)
- Space Complexity: O(__)
- Code:
```javascript
function selectionSort(array) {
  
}
```

3. Explain the complexity of and write a function that performs insertion sort on an array of numbers.
- Time Complexity: O(__)
- Space Complexity: O(__)
- Code:
```javascript
function insertionSort(array) {
  
}
```

4. Explain the complexity of and write a function that performs merge sort on an array of numbers.
- Time Complexity: O(__)
- Space Complexity: O(__)
- Code:
```javascript
function mergeSort(array) {
  
}
```

5. Explain the complexity of and write a function that performs quick sort on an array of numbers.
- Time Complexity: O(__)
- Space Complexity: O(__)
- Code:
```javascript
function quickSort(array) {
  
}
```

6. Explain the complexity of and write a function that performs a binary search on a sorted array of numbers.
- Time Complexity: O(__)
- Space Complexity: O(__)
- Code:
```javascript
function bindarySearch(array) {
  
}
```
