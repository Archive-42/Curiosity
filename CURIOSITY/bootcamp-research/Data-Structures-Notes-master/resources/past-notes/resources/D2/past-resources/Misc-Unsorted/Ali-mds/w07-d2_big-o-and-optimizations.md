# Big-O By Colt Steele

Colt Steele provides a very nice, non-mathy introduction to Big-O notation.
Please watch this so you can get the easy introduction. Big-O is, by its very
nature, math based. It's good to get an understanding before jumping in to
math expressions.

# Curating Complexity: A Guide to Big-O Notation

As software engineers, our goal is not just to solve problems. Rather, our goal
is to solve problems efficiently and elegantly. Not all solutions are made
equal! In this section we'll explore how to analyze the efficiency of algorithms
in terms of their speed (_time complexity_) and memory consumption (_space
complexity_).

> In this article, we'll use the word _efficiency_ to describe the amount of
> resources a program needs to execute. The two resources we are concerned with
> are _time_ and _space_. Our goal is to _minimize_ the amount of time and space
> that our programs use.

When you finish this article you will be able to:

- explain why computer scientists use Big-O notation
- simplify a mathematical function into Big-O notation

## Why Big-O?

Let's begin by understanding what method we should _not_ use when describing the
efficiency of our algorithms. Most importantly, we'll want to avoid using
absolute units of time when describing speed. When the software engineer
exclaims, "My function runs in 0.2 seconds, it's so fast!!!", the computer
scientist is not impressed. Skeptical, the computer scientist asks the following
questions:

1. What computer did you run it on? _Maybe the credit belongs to the hardware
   and not the software. Some hardware architectures will be better for certain
   operations than others._
2. Were there other background processes running on the computer that could have
   effected the runtime? _It's hard to control the environment during
   performance experiments._
3. Will your code still be performant if we increase the size of the input? _For
   example, sorting 3 numbers is trivial; but how about a million numbers?_

The job of the software engineer is to focus on the software detail and not
necessarily the hardware it will run on. Because we can't answer points 1 and 2
with total certainty, we'll want to avoid using concrete units like
"milliseconds" or "seconds" when describing the efficiency of our algorithms.
Instead, we'll opt for a more abstract approach that focuses on point 3. This
means that we should focus on how the performance of our algorithm is affected
by increasing the size of the input. **In other words, how does our performance
scale?**

> The argument above focuses on _time_, but a similar argument could also be
> made for _space_. For example, we should not analyze our code in terms of the
> amount of absolute kilobytes of memory it uses, because this is dependent on
> the programming language.

## Big-O Notation

In Computer Science, we use Big-O notation as a tool for describing the
efficiency of algorithms with respect to the size of the input argument(s). We
use mathematical functions in Big-O notation, so there are a few big picture
ideas that we'll want to keep in mind:

1. The function should be defined in terms of the size of the input(s).
2. A _smaller_ Big-O function is more desirable than a larger one. Intuitively,
   we want our algorithms to use a minimal amount of time and space.
3. Big-O describes the worst-case scenario for our code, also known as the
   upper bound. We prepare our algorithm for the worst case, because the
   best case is a luxury that is not guaranteed.
4. A Big-O function should be simplified to show only its most dominant
   mathematical term.

The first 3 points are conceptual, so they are easy to swallow. However, point 4
is typically the biggest source of confusion when learning the notation. Before
we apply Big-O to our code, we'll need to first understand the underlying math
and simplification process.

### Simplifying Math Terms

We want our Big-O notation to describe the performance of our algorithm with
respect to the input size and nothing else. Because of this, we should to
simplify our Big-O functions using the following rules:

- **Simplify Products:** if the function is a product of many terms, we drop the
  terms that _don't_ depend on the size of the input.
- **Simplify Sums:** if the function is a sum of many terms, we keep the term
  with the _largest_ growth rate and drop the other terms.

We'll look at these rules in action, but first we'll define a few things:

- **n** is the size of the input
- **T(f)** refers to an unsimplified mathematical **f**unction
- **O(f)** refers to the Big-O simplified mathematical **f**unction

### Simplifying a Product

If a function consists of a product of many factors, we drop the factors that
don't depend on the size of the input, n. The factors that we drop are called
constant factors because their size remains consistent as we increase the size
of the input. The reasoning behind this simplification is that we make the input
large enough, the non-constant factors will overshadow the constant ones. Below
are some examples:

| Unsimplified            | Big-O Simplified   |
| ----------------------- | ------------------ |
| T( 5 \* n<sup>2</sup> ) | O( n<sup>2</sup> ) |
| T( 100000 \* n )        | O( n )             |
| T( n / 12 )             | O( n )             |
| T( 42 \* n \* log(n) )  | O( n \* log(n) )   |
| T( 12 )                 | O( 1 )             |

Note that in the third example, we can simplify `T( n / 12 )` to `O( n )`
because we can rewrite a division into an equivalent multiplication. In other
words, `T( n / 12 ) = T( 1/12 * n ) = O( n )`.

### Simplifying a Sum

If the function consists of a sum of many terms, we only need to show the term
that grows the fastest, relative to the size of the input. The reasoning behind
this simplification is that if we make the input large enough, the fastest
growing term will overshadow the other, smaller terms. To understand which term
to keep, you'll need to recall the relative size of our common math terms from
the previous section. Below are some examples:

| Unsimplified                           | Big-O Simplified   |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| T( n<sup>3</sup> + n<sup>2</sup> + n ) | O( n<sup>3</sup> ) |
| T( log(n) + 2<sup>n</sup> )            | O( 2<sup>n</sup> ) |
| T( n + log(n) )                        | O( n )             |
| T( n! + 10<sup>n</sup> )               | O( n! )            |

### Putting it all together

The _product_ and _sum_ rules are all we'll need to Big-O simplify any math
functions. We just apply the _product rule_ to drop all constants, then apply the
_sum rule_ to select the single most dominant term.

| Unsimplified                          | Big-O Simplified   |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| T( 5n<sup>2</sup> + 99n )             | O( n<sup>2</sup> ) |
| T( 2n + nlog(n) )                     | O( nlog(n) )       |
| T( 2<sup>n</sup> + 5n<sup>1000</sup>) | O( 2<sup>n</sup> ) |

> Aside: We'll often omit the multiplication symbol in expressions as a form of
> shorthand. For example, we'll write _O( 5n<sup>2</sup> )_ in place of _O( 5 \*
> n<sup>2</sup> )_.

## What you've learned

In this reading we:

- explained why Big-O is the preferred notation used to describe the efficiency
  of algorithms
- used the product and sum rules to simplify mathematical functions into Big-O
  notation

# Common Complexity Classes

Analyzing the efficiency of our code seems like a daunting task because there
are many different possibilities in how we may choose to implement something.
Luckily, most code we write can be categorized into one of a handful of common
complexity classes. In this reading, we'll identify the common classes and
explore some of the code characteristics that will lead to these classes.

When you finish this reading, you should be able to:

- name _and_ order the seven common complexity classes
- identify the time complexity class of a given code snippet

## The seven major classes

There are seven complexity classes that we will encounter most often. Below is a
list of each complexity class as well as its Big-O notation. This list is
ordered from _smallest to largest_. Bear in mind that a "more efficient"
algorithm is one with a smaller complexity class, because it requires fewer
resources.

| Big-O                                                       | Complexity Class Name                |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| O(1)                                                        | constant                             |
| O(log(n))                                                   | logarithmic                          |
| O(n)                                                        | linear                               |
| O(n \* log(n))                                              | loglinear, linearithmic, quasilinear |
| O(n<sup>c</sup>) - O(n<sup>2</sup>), O(n<sup>3</sup>), etc. | polynomial                           |
| O(c<sup>n</sup>) - O(2<sup>n</sup>), O(3<sup>n</sup>), etc. | exponential                          |
| O(n!)                                                       | factorial                            |

There are more complexity classes that exist, but these are most common. Let's
take a closer look at each of these classes to gain some intuition on what
behavior their functions define. We'll explore famous algorithms that correspond
to these classes further in the course.

For simplicity, we'll provide small, generic code examples that illustrate the
complexity, although they may not solve a practical problem.

### O(1) - Constant

Constant complexity means that the algorithm takes roughly the same number of
steps for any size input. In a constant time algorithm, there is no relationship
between the size of the input and the number of steps required. For example,
this means performing the algorithm on a input of size 1 takes the same number
of steps as performing it on an input of size 128.

#### Constant growth

The table below shows the growing behavior of a constant function. Notice that
the behavior stays _constant_ for all values of n.

| n   | O(1) |
| --- | ---- |
| 1   | ~1   |
| 2   | ~1   |
| 3   | ~1   |
| ... | ...  |
| 128 | ~1   |

#### Example Constant code

Below is are two examples of functions that have constant runtimes.

```javascript
// O(1)
function constant1(n) {
  return n * 2 + 1;
}

// O(1)
function constant2(n) {
  for (let i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
    console.log(i);
  }
}
```

The runtime of the `constant1` function does not depend on the size of the
input, because only two arithmetic operations (multiplication and addition) are
always performed. The runtime of the `constant2` function also does not depend
on the size of the input because one-hundred iterations are always performed,
irrespective of the input.

### O(log(n)) - Logarithmic

Typically, the hidden base of O(log(n)) is 2, meaning O(log<sub>2</sub>(n)).
Logarithmic complexity algorithms will usual display a sense of continually
"halving" the size of the input. Another tell of a logarithmic algorithm is that
we don't have to access every element of the input. O(log<sub>2</sub>(n)) means
that every time we double the size of the input, we only require one additional
step. Overall, this means that a large increase of input size will increase the
number of steps required by a small amount.

#### Logarithmic growth

The table below shows the growing behavior of a logarithmic runtime function.
Notice that doubling the input size will only require only one additional
"step".

| n   | O(log<sub>2</sub>(n)) |
| --- | --------------------- |
| 2   | ~1                    |
| 4   | ~2                    |
| 8   | ~3                    |
| 16  | ~4                    |
| ... | ...                   |
| 128 | ~7                    |

#### Example logarithmic code

Below is an example of two functions with logarithmic runtimes.

```javascript
// O(log(n))
function logarithmic1(n) {
  if (n <= 1) return;
  logarithmic1(n / 2);
}

// O(log(n))
function logarithmic2(n) {
  let i = n;
  while (i > 1) {
    i /= 2;
  }
}
```

The `logarithmic1` function has O(log(n)) runtime because the recursion will
half the argument, n, each time. In other words, if we pass 8 as the original
argument, then the recursive chain would be 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1. In a similar way,
the `logarithmic2` function has O(log(n)) runtime because of the number of
iterations in the while loop. The while loop depends on the variable `i`, which
will be divided in half each iteration.

### O(n) - Linear

Linear complexity algorithms will access each item of the input "once" (in the
Big-O sense). Algorithms that iterate through the input without nested loops or
recurse by reducing the size of the input by "one" each time are typically
linear.

#### Linear growth

The table below shows the growing behavior of a linear runtime function. Notice
that a change in input size leads to similar change in the number of steps.

| n   | O(n) |
| --- | ---- |
| 1   | ~1   |
| 2   | ~2   |
| 3   | ~3   |
| 4   | ~4   |
| ... | ...  |
| 128 | ~128 |

#### Example linear code

Below are examples of three functions that each have linear runtime.

```javascript
// O(n)
function linear1(n) {
  for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    console.log(i);
  }
}

// O(n), where n is the length of the array
function linear2(array) {
  for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
    console.log(i);
  }
}

// O(n)
function linear3(n) {
  if (n === 1) return;
  linear3(n - 1);
}
```

The `linear1` function has O(n) runtime because the for loop will iterate n
times. The `linear2` function has O(n) runtime because the for loop iterates
through the array argument. The `linear3` function has O(n) runtime because each
subsequent call in the recursion will decrease the argument by one. In other
words, if we pass 8 as the original argument to `linear3`, the recursive chain
would be 8 -> 7 -> 6 -> 5 -> ... -> 1.

### O(n \* log(n)) - Loglinear

This class is a combination of both linear and logarithmic behavior, so features
from both classes are evident. Algorithms the exhibit this behavior use both
recursion and iteration. Typically, this means that the recursive calls will
halve the input each time (logarithmic), but iterations are also performed on
the input (linear).

#### Loglinear growth

The table below shows the growing behavior of a loglinear runtime function.

| n   | O(n \* log<sub>2</sub>(n)) |
| --- | -------------------------- |
| 2   | ~2                         |
| 4   | ~8                         |
| 8   | ~24                        |
| ... | ...                        |
| 128 | ~896                       |

#### Example loglinear code

Below is an example of a function with a loglinear runtime.

```javascript
// O(n * log(n))
function loglinear(n) {
  if (n <= 1) return;

  for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    console.log(i);
  }

  loglinear(n / 2);
  loglinear(n / 2);
}
```

The `loglinear` function has O(n \* log(n)) runtime because the for loop
iterates linearly (n) through the input and the recursive chain behaves
logarithmically (log(n)).

### O(n<sup>c</sup>) - Polynomial

Polynomial complexity refers to complexity of the form O(n<sup>c</sup>) where
`n` is the size of the input and `c` is some fixed constant. For example,
O(n<sup>3</sup>) is a larger/worse function than O(n<sup>2</sup>), but they
belong to the same complexity class. Nested loops are usually the indicator of
this complexity class.

#### Polynomial growth

Below are tables showing the growth for O(n<sup>2</sup>) and O(n<sup>3</sup>).

| n   | O(n<sup>2</sup>) |
| --- | ---------------- |
| 1   | ~1               |
| 2   | ~4               |
| 3   | ~9               |
| ... | ...              |
| 128 | ~16,384          |

| n   | O(n<sup>3</sup>) |
| --- | ---------------- |
| 1   | ~1               |
| 2   | ~8               |
| 3   | ~27              |
| ... | ...              |
| 128 | ~2,097,152       |

#### Example polynomial code

Below are examples of two functions with polynomial runtimes.

```javascript
// O(n^2)
function quadratic(n) {
  for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    for (let j = 1; j <= n; j++) {}
  }
}

// O(n^3)
function cubic(n) {
  for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    for (let j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
      for (let k = 1; k <= n; k++) {}
    }
  }
}
```

The `quadratic` function has O(n<sup>2</sup>) runtime because there are nested
loops. The outer loop iterates n times and the inner loop iterates n times. This
leads to n \* n total number of iterations. In a similar way, the `cubic`
function has O(n<sup>3</sup>) runtime because it has triply nested loops that
lead to a total of n \* n \* n iterations.

### O(c<sup>n</sup>) - Exponential

Exponential complexity refers to Big-O functions of the form O(c<sup>n</sup>)
where `n` is the size of the input and `c` is some fixed constant. For example,
O(3<sup>n</sup>) is a larger/worse function than O(2<sup>n</sup>), but they both
belong to the exponential complexity class. A common indicator of this
complexity class is recursive code where there is a constant number of recursive
calls in each stack frame. The `c` will be the number of recursive calls made in
each stack frame. Algorithms with this complexity are considered quite slow.

#### Exponential growth

Below are tables showing the growth for O(2<sup>n</sup>) and O(3<sup>n</sup>).
Notice how these grow large, quickly.

| n   | O(2<sup>n</sup>)           |
| --- | -------------------------- |
| 1   | ~2                         |
| 2   | ~4                         |
| 3   | ~8                         |
| 4   | ~16                        |
| ... | ...                        |
| 128 | ~3.4028 \* 10<sup>38</sup> |

| n   | O(3<sup>n</sup>)           |
| --- | -------------------------- |
| 1   | ~3                         |
| 2   | ~9                         |
| 3   | ~27                        |
| 3   | ~81                        |
| ... | ...                        |
| 128 | ~1.1790 \* 10<sup>61</sup> |

#### Exponential code example

Below are examples of two functions with exponential runtimes.

```javascript
// O(2^n)
function exponential2n(n) {
  if (n === 1) return;
  exponential_2n(n - 1);
  exponential_2n(n - 1);
}

// O(3^n)
function exponential3n(n) {
  if (n === 0) return;
  exponential_3n(n - 1);
  exponential_3n(n - 1);
  exponential_3n(n - 1);
}
```

The `exponential2n` function has O(2<sup>n</sup>) runtime because each call will
make two more recursive calls. The `exponential3n` function has O(3<sup>n</sup>)
runtime because each call will make three more recursive calls.

### O(n!) - Factorial

Recall that `n! = (n) * (n - 1) * (n - 2) * ... * 1`. This complexity is
typically the largest/worst that we will end up implementing. An indicator of
this complexity class is recursive code that has a variable number of recursive
calls in each stack frame. Note that _factorial_ is worse than _exponential_
because _factorial_ algorithms have a _variable_ amount of recursive calls in
each stack frame, whereas _exponential_ algorithms have a _constant_ amount of
recursive calls in each frame.

#### Factorial growth

Below is a table showing the growth for O(n!). Notice how this has a more
aggressive growth than exponential behavior.

| n   | O(n!)                       |
| --- | --------------------------- |
| 1   | ~1                          |
| 2   | ~2                          |
| 3   | ~6                          |
| 4   | ~24                         |
| ... | ...                         |
| 128 | ~3.8562 \* 10<sup>215</sup> |

#### Factorial code example

Below is an example of a function with factorial runtime.

```javascript
// O(n!)
function factorial(n) {
  if (n === 1) return;

  for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    factorial(n - 1);
  }
}
```

The `factorial` function has O(n!) runtime because the code is _recursive_ but
the number of recursive calls made in a single stack frame depends on the input.
This contrasts with an _exponential_ function because exponential functions have
a _fixed_ number of calls in each stack frame.

You may it difficult to identify the complexity class of a given code snippet,
especially if the code falls into the loglinear, exponential, or factorial
classes. In the upcoming videos, we'll explain the analysis of these functions
in greater detail. For now, you should focus on the _relative order_ of these
seven complexity classes!

## What you've learned

In this reading, we listed the seven common complexity classes and saw some
example code for each. In order of ascending growth, the seven classes are:

1. Constant
2. Logarithmic
3. Linear
4. Loglinear
5. Polynomial
6. Exponential
7. Factorial

# Memoization

**Memoization** is a design pattern used to reduce the overall number of
calculations that can occur in algorithms that use recursive strategies to
solve.

Recall that recursion solves a large problem by dividing it into smaller
sub-problems that are more manageable. Memoization will store the results of
the sub-problems in some other data structure, meaning that you avoid duplicate
calculations and only "solve" each subproblem once. There are two features that
comprise memoization:

+ the function is recursive
+ the additional data structure used is typically an object (we refer to this as
  the memo!)

This is a trade-off between the time it takes to run an algorithm (without
memoization) and the memory used to run the algorithm (with memoization).
Usually memoization is a good trade-off when dealing with large data or
calculations.

You cannot always apply this technique to recursive problems. The problem must
have an "overlapping subproblem structure" for memoization to be effective.

Here's an example of a problem that has such a structure:

> Using pennies, nickels, dimes, and quarters, what is the smallest combination
> of coins that total 27 cents?

You'll explore this exact problem in depth later on. For now, here is some food
for thought. Along the way to calculating the smallest coin combination of 27
cents, you should also calculate the smallest coin combination of say, 25 cents
as a component of that problem. This is the essence of an overlapping subproblem
structure.

## Memoizing factorial

Here's an example of a function that computes the factorial of the number passed
into it.

```javascript
function factorial(n) {
  if (n === 1) return 1;
  return n * factorial(n - 1);
}

factorial(6);       // => 720, requires 6 calls
factorial(6);       // => 720, requires 6 calls
factorial(5);       // => 120, requires 5 calls
factorial(7);       // => 5040, requires 7 calls
```

From this plain `factorial` above, it is clear that every time you call
`factorial(6)` you should get the same result of `720` each time. The code is
somewhat inefficient because you must go down the full recursive stack for each
top level call to `factorial(6)`. It would be great if you could store the result
of `factorial(6)` the first time you calculate it, then on subsequent calls to
`factorial(6)` you simply fetch the stored result in constant time. You can
accomplish exactly this by memoizing with an object!

```javascript
let memo = {}

function factorial(n) {
  // if this function has calculated factorial(n) previously,
  // fetch the stored result in memo
  if (n in memo) return memo[n];
  if (n === 1) return 1;

  // otherwise, it havs not calculated factorial(n) previously,
  // so calculate it now, but store the result in case it is
  // needed again in the future
  memo[n] = n * factorial(n - 1);
  return memo[n]
}

factorial(6);       // => 720, requires 6 calls
factorial(6);       // => 720, requires 1 call
factorial(5);       // => 120, requires 1 call
factorial(7);       // => 5040, requires 2 calls

memo;   // => { '2': 2, '3': 6, '4': 24, '5': 120, '6': 720, '7': 5040 }
```

The `memo` object above will map an argument of `factorial` to its return
value. That is, the keys will be arguments and their values will be the
corresponding results returned. By using the memo, you are able to avoid
duplicate recursive calls!

Here's some food for thought: By the time your first call to `factorial(6)`
returns, you will not have just the argument `6` stored in the memo. Rather, you will
have _all_ arguments 2 to 6 stored in the memo.

Hopefully you sense the efficiency you can get by memoizing your functions, but
maybe you are not convinced by the last example for two reasons:

+ You didn't improve the speed of the algorithm by an order of Big-O (it is
  still O(n)).
+ The code uses some global variable, so it's kind of ugly.

Both of those points are true, so take a look at a more advanced example that
benefits from memoization.

## Memoizing the Fibonacci generator

Here's a _naive_ implementation of a function that calculates the Fibonacci
number for a given input.

```javascript
function fib(n) {
  if (n === 1 || n === 2) return 1;
  return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2);
}

fib(6);     // => 8
```

Before you optimize this, ask yourself what complexity class it falls into in
the first place.

The time complexity of this function is not super intuitive to describe because
the code branches twice recursively. Fret not! You'll find it useful to
visualize the calls needed to do this with a tree. When reasoning about the time
complexity for recursive functions, draw a tree that helps you see the calls.
Every node of the tree represents a call of the recursion:

![fib_tree](images/fib_tree.png)

In general, the height of this tree will be `n`. You derive this by following
the path going straight down the left side of the tree. You can also see that
each internal node leads to two more nodes. Overall, this means that the tree
will have roughly 2<sup>n</sup> nodes which is the same as saying that the `fib`
function has an exponential time complexity of 2<sup>n</sup>. That is very slow!
See for yourself, try running `fib(50)` -  you'll be waiting for quite a while
(it took 3 minutes on the author's machine).

Okay. So the `fib` function is slow. Is there anyway to speed it up? Take a look
at the tree above. Can you find any repetitive regions of the tree?

![fib_tree_duplicates](images/fib_tree_duplicates.png)

As the `n` grows bigger, the number of duplicate sub-trees grows exponentially.
Luckily you can fix this using memoization by using a similar object strategy as
before. You can use some JavaScript default arguments to clean things up:

```javascript
function fastFib(n, memo = {}) {
  if (n in memo) return memo[n];
  if (n === 1 || n === 2) return 1;

  memo[n] = fastFib(n - 1, memo) + fastFib(n - 2, memo);
  return memo[n];
}

fastFib(6);     // => 8
fastFib(50);    // => 12586269025
```

The code above can calculate the 50th Fibonacci number almost instantly! Thanks
to the `memo` object, you only need to explore a subtree fully once. Visually,
the `fastFib` recursion has this structure:

![fib_memoized](images/fib_memoized.png)

You can see the marked nodes (function calls) that access the memo in green.
It's easy to see that this version of the Fibonacci generator will do far less
computations as `n` grows larger! In fact, this memoization has brought the time
complexity down to linear `O(n)` time because the tree only branches on the left
side. This is an enormous gain if you recall the complexity class hierarchy.

## The memoization formula

Now that you understand memoization, when should you apply it? Memoization is
useful when attacking recursive problems that have many overlapping
sub-problems. You'll find it most useful to draw out the visual tree first. If
you notice duplicate sub-trees, time to memoize. Here are the hard and fast
rules you can use to memoize a slow function:

1. Write the unoptimized, brute force recursion and make sure it works.
2. Add the memo object as an additional argument to the function. The keys will
   represent unique arguments to the function, and their values will represent
   the results for those arguments.
3. Add a base case condition to the function that returns the stored value if
   the function's argument is in the memo.
4. Before you return the result of the recursive case, store it in the memo as a
   value and make the function's argument it's key.

## What you learned

You learned a secret to possibly changing an algorithm of one complexity class
to a lower complexity class by using memory to store intermediate results. This
is a powerful technique to use to make sure your programs that must do recursive
calculations can benefit from running much faster.

________________________________________________________________________________
# Tabulation

Now that you are familiar with _memoization_, you can explore a related method
of algorithmic optimization: **Tabulation**. There are two main features that
comprise the Tabulation strategy:

* the function is iterative and *not* recursive
* the additional data structure used is typically an array, commonly referred to
  as the table

Many problems that can be solved with memoization can also be solved with
tabulation as long as you convert the recursion to iteration. The first example
is the canonical example of recursion, calculating the Fibonacci number for an
input. However, in the example, you'll see the iteration version of it for a
fresh start!

## Tabulating the Fibonacci number

Tabulation is all about creating a table (array) and filling it out with
elements. In general, you will complete the table by filling entries from "left
to right". This means that the first entry of the table (first element of the
array) will correspond to the smallest subproblem. Naturally, the final entry of
the table (last element of the array) will correspond to the largest problem,
which is also the final answer.

Here's a way to use tabulation to store the intermediary calculations so that
later calculations can refer back to the table.

```javascript
function tabulatedFib(n) {
  // create a blank array with n reserved spots
  let table = new Array(n);

  // seed the first two values
  table[0] = 0;
  table[1] = 1;

  // complete the table by moving from left to right,
  // following the fibonacci pattern
  for (let i = 2; i <= n; i += 1) {
    table[i] = table[i - 1] + table[i - 2];
  }

  return table[n];
}

console.log(tabulatedFib(7));      // => 13
```

When you initialized the table and seeded the first two values, it looked like
this:

| i          | 0   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   | 7   |
| ---------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `table[i]` | `0` | `1` |     |     |     |     |     |     |


After the loop finishes, the final table will be:

| i          | 0   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   | 7    |
| ---------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---- |
| `table[i]` | `0` | `1` | `1` | `2` | `3` | `5` | `8` | `13` |

Similar to the previous `memo`, by the time the function completes, the `table`
will contain the final solution as well as all sub-solutions calculated along
the way.

To compute the complexity class of this `tabulatedFib` is very straightforward
since the code is iterative. The dominant operation in the function is the loop
used to fill out the entire table. The length of the table is roughly `n`
elements long, so the algorithm will have an _O(n)_ runtime. The space taken by
our algorithm is also _O(n)_ due to the size of the table. Overall, this should
be a satisfying solution for the efficiency of the algorithm.

## Aside: Refactoring for O(1) Space

You may notice that you can cut down on the space used by the function. At any
point of the loop, the calculation really only need the previous two
subproblems' results. There is little utility to storing the full array. This
refactor is easy to do by using two variables:

```javascript
function fib(n) {
  let mostRecentCalcs = [0, 1];

  if (n === 0) return mostRecentCalcs[0];

  for (let i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
    const [ secondLast, last ] = mostRecentCalcs;
    mostRecentCalcs = [ last, secondLast + last ];
  }

  return mostRecentCalcs[1];
}
```

Bam! You now have O(n) runtime and O(1) space. This is the most optimal
algorithm for calculating a Fibonacci number. Note that this strategy is a pared
down form of tabulation, since it uses only the last two values.

### The Tabulation Formula

Here are the general guidelines for implementing the tabulation strategy. This
is just a general recipe, so adjust for taste depending on your problem:

1. Create the table array based off of the size of the input, which isn't always
   straightforward if you have multiple input values
2. Initialize some values in the table that "answer" the trivially small
   subproblem usually by initializing the first entry (or entries) of the table
3. Iterate through the array and fill in remaining entries, using previous
   entries in the table to perform the current calculation
4. Your final answer is (usually) the last entry in the table

## What you learned

You learned another way of possibly changing an algorithm of one complexity
class to a lower complexity class by using memory to store intermediate results.
This is a powerful technique to use to make sure your programs that must do
iterative calculations can benefit from running much faster.

# Analysis of Linear Search

Consider the following search algorithm known as **linear search**.

```javascript
function search(array, term) {
  for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
    if (array[i] == term) {
      return i;
    }
  }
  return -1;
}
```

Most Big-O analysis is done on the "worst-case scenario" and provides an upper
bound. In the worst case analysis, you calculate the upper bound on running time
of an algorithm. You must know the case that causes the maximum number of
operations to be executed.

For _linear search_, the worst case happens when the element to be searched
(`term` in the above code) is not present in the array. When `term` is not
present, the `search` function compares it with all the elements of `array` one
by one. Therefore, the worst-case time complexity of linear search would be
O(n).

________________________________________________________________________________
# Analysis of Binary Search

Consider the following search algorithm known as the **binary search**. This
kind of search only works if the array is already sorted.

```javascript
function binarySearch(arr, x, start, end) {
  if (start > end) return false;

  let mid = Math.floor((start + end) / 2);
  if (arr[mid] === x) return true;

  if (arr[mid] > x) {
    return binarySearch(arr, x, start, mid - 1);
  } else {
    return binarySearch(arr, x, mid + 1, end);
  }
}
```

For the _binary search_, you cut the search space in half every time. This means
that it reduces the number of searches you must do by half, every time. That
means the number of steps it takes to get to the desired item (if it exists in
the array), in the worst case takes the same amount of steps for every number
within a range defined by the powers of 2.

* 7 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1
* 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1
* 9 -> 5 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1
* 15 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1
* 16 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1
* 17 -> 9 -> 5 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1
* 31 -> 16 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1
* 32 -> 16 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1
* 33 -> 17 -> 9 -> 5 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1

So, for any number of items in the sorted array between 2<sup>n-1</sup> and
2<sup>n</sup>, it takes _n_ number of steps. That means if you have _k_ items in
the array, then it will take <i>log</i><sub><i>2</i></sub><i>k</i>.

Binary searches are <i>O</i>(<i>log</i><sub><i>2</i></sub><i>n</i>).

________________________________________________________________________________
# Analysis of the Merge Sort

Consider the following divide-and-conquer sort method known as the **merge
sort**.

```javascript
function merge(leftArray, rightArray) {
  const sorted = [];
  while (leftArray.length > 0 && rightArray.length > 0) {
    const leftItem = leftArray[0];
    const rightItem = rightArray[0];

    if (leftItem > rightItem) {
      sorted.push(rightItem);
      rightArray.shift();
    } else {
      sorted.push(leftItem);
      leftArray.shift();
    }
  }

  while (leftArray.length !== 0) {
    const value = leftArray.shift();
    sorted.push(value);
  }

  while (rightArray.length !== 0) {
    const value = rightArray.shift();
    sorted.push(value);
  }

  return sorted
}

function mergeSort(array) {
  const length = array.length;
  if (length == 1) {
    return array;
  }

  const middleIndex = Math.ceil(length / 2);
  const leftArray = array.slice(0, middleIndex);
  const rightArray = array.slice(middleIndex, length);

  leftArray = mergeSort(leftArray);
  rightArray = mergeSort(rightArray);

  return merge(leftArray, rightArray);
}
```


For the _merge sort_, you cut the sort space in half every time. In each of
those halves, you have to loop through the number of items in the array. That
means that, for the worst case, you get that same
<i>log</i><sub><i>2</i></sub><i>n</i> but it must be multiplied by the number of
elements in the array, _n_.

Merge sorts are <i>O</i>(<i>n*log</i><sub><i>2</i></sub><i>n</i>).

________________________________________________________________________________
# Analysis of Bubble Sort

Consider the following sort algorithm known as the **bubble sort**.

```javascript
function bubbleSort(items) {
  var length = items.length;
  for (var i = 0; i < length; i++) {
    for (var j = 0; j < (length - i - 1); j++) {
      if (items[j] > items[j + 1]) {
        var tmp = items[j];
        items[j] = items[j + 1];
        items[j + 1] = tmp;
      }
    }
  }
}
```


For the _bubble sort_, the worst case is the same as the best case because it
always makes nested loops. So, the outer loop loops the number of times of the
items in the array. For each one of those loops, the inner loop loops again a
number of times for the items in the array. So, if there are _n_ values in the
array, then a loop inside a loop is _n_ * _n_. So, this is O(n<sup>2</sup>).
That's polynomial, which ain't that good.
