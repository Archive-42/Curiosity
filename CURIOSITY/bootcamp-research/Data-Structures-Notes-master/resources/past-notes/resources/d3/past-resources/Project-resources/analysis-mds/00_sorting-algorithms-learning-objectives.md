# Sorting Algorithms Learning Objectives

**The objective of this lesson** is for you to get experience implementing
common sorting algorithms that will come up during a lot of interviews. It is
also important for you to understand how different sorting algorithms behave
when given output.

At the end of this, you will be able to

1. Explain the complexity of and write a function that performs `bubble sort` on
   an array of numbers.
2. Explain the complexity of and write a function that performs `selection sort`
   on an array of numbers.
3. Explain the complexity of and write a function that performs `insertion sort`
   on an array of numbers.
4. Explain the complexity of and write a function that performs `merge sort` on
   an array of numbers.
5. Explain the complexity of and write a function that performs `quick sort` on
   an array of numbers.
6. Explain the complexity of and write a function that performs a binary search
   on a sorted array of numbers.
