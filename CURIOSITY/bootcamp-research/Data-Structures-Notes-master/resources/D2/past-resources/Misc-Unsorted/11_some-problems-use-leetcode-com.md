# LeetCode.com

Some of the problems in the projects ask you to use the LeetCode platform to
check your work rather than relying on local mocha tests. If you don't already
have an account at LeetCode.com, please click
https://leetcode.com/accounts/signup/ to sign up for a free account.

After you sign up for the account, please verify the account with the email
address that you used so that you can actually run your solution on
LeetCode.com.

In the projects, you will see files that are named "leet_code_«number».js".
When you open those, you will see a link in the file that you can use to go
directly to the corresponding problem on LeetCode.com.

Use the local JavaScript file in Visual Studio Code to collaborate on the
solution. Then, you can run the proposed solution in the LeetCode.com code
runner to validate its correctness.
