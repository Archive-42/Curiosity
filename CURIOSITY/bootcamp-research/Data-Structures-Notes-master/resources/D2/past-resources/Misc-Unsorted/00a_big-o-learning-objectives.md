# Big-O Learning Objectives

**The objective of this lesson** is get you comfortable with identifying the
time and space complexity of code you see. Being able to diagnose time
complexity for algorithms is an essential for interviewing software engineers.

At the end of this, you will be able to

1. Order the common complexity classes according to their growth rate
2. Identify the complexity classes of common sort methods
3. Identify complexity classes of code
