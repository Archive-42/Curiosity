This is a generic version of the left frame script.  Add whatever else you desire.

Any script that doesn't replace /FOLDER_HREF_APPEND or /FOLDER_FILE_LINK can be appended to this file.

/FOLDER_HREF_APPEND
target="rframe"
/FOLDER_FILE_LINK
right.html
//
//  Note that as an alternative to using /FOLDER_HREF_APPEND, it's also possible to use this:
//  /HEAD
//  <base target="rfame">
//
//  However, for an xhtml build, it would have to be <base target="rfame" /> to validate properly
